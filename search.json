Year br CENTER p table td width td td P nbsp p b Call me b Mr Gatto please Twenty six years ago having nothing better to do I tried my hand at schoolteaching My license certifies me as an instructor of English language and literature but that isn t what I do at all What I teach is school and I win awards doing it P Teaching means many different things but six lessons are common to schoolteaching from Harlem to Hollywood You pay for these lessons in more ways than you can imagine so you might as well know what they are P b The first b lesson I teach is Stay in the class where you belong I don t know who decides that my kids belong there but that s not my business The children are numbered so that if any get away they can be returned to the right class Over the years the variety of ways children are numbered has increased dramatically until it is hard to see the human being under the burden of the numbers each carries Numbering children is a big and very profitable business though what the business is designed to accomplish is elusive P In any case again that s not my business My job is to make the kids like it being locked in together I mean or at the minimum endure it If things go well the kids can t imagine themselves anywhere else they envy and fear the better classes and have contempt for the dumber classes So the class mostly keeps itself in good marching order That s the real lesson of any rigged competition like school You come to know your place P Nevertheless in spite of the overall blueprint I make an effort to urge children to higher levels of test success promising eventual transfer from the lower level class as a reward I insinuate that the day will come when an employer will hire them on the basis of test scores even though my own experience is that employers are rightly indifferent to such things I never lie outright but I ve come to see that truth and school teaching are incompatible P The lesson of numbered classes is that there is no way out of your class except by magic Until that happens you must stay where you are put P b The second b lesson I teach kids is to turn on and off like a light switch I demand that they become totally involved in my lessons jumping up and down in their seats with anticipation competing vigorously with each other for my favor But when the bell rings I insist that they drop the work at once and proceed quickly to the next work station Nothing important is ever finished in my class nor in any other class I know of P The lesson of bells is that no work is worth finishing so why care too deeply about anything Bells are the secret logic of schooltime their argument is inexorable bells destroy past and future converting every interval into a sameness as an abstract map makes every living mountain and river the same even though they are not Bells inoculate each undertaking with indifference P b The third b lesson I teach you is to surrender your will to a predestined chain of command Rights may be granted or withheld by authority without appeal As a schoolteacher I intervene in many personal decisions issuing a Pass for those I deem legitimate or initiating a disciplinary confrontation for behavior that threatens my control My judgments come thick and fast because individuality is trying constantly to assert itself in my classroom Individuality is a curse to all systems of classification a contradiction of class theory P Here are some common ways it shows up children sneak away for a private moment in the toilet on the pretext of moving their bowels they trick me out of a private instant in the hallway on the grounds that they need water Sometimes free will appears right in front of me in children angry depressed or exhilarated by things outside my ken Rights in such things cannot exist for schoolteachers only privileges which can be withdrawn exist P b The fourth b lesson I teach is that only I determine what curriculum you will study Rather I enforce decisions transmitted by the people who pay me This power lets me separate good kids from bad kids instantly Good kids do the tasks I appoint with a minimum of conflict and a decent show of enthusiasm Of the millions of things of value to learn I decide what few we have time for The choices are mine Curiosity has no important place in my work only conformity P Bad kids fight against this of course trying openly or covertly to make decisions for themselves about what they will learn How can we allow that and survive as schoolteachers Fortunately there are procedures to break the will of those who resist P This is another way I teach the lesson of dependency Good people wait for a teacher to tell them what to do This is the most important lesson of all that we must wait for other people better trained than ourselves to make the meanings of our lives It is no exaggeration to say that our entire economy depends upon this lesson being learned Think of what would fall apart if kids weren t trained in the dependency lesson The social service businesses could hardly survive including the fast growing counseling industry commercial entertainment of all sorts along with television would wither if people remembered how to make their own fun the food services restaurants and prepared food warehouses would shrink if people returned to making their own meals rather than depending on strangers to cook for them Much of modern law medicine and engineering would go too the clothing business as well unless a guaranteed supply of helpless people poured out of our schools each year We ve built a way of life that depends on people doing what they are told because they don t know any other way For God s sake let s not rock that boat P b In lesson b five I teach that your self respect should depend on an observer s measure of your worth My kids are constantly evaluated and judged A monthly report impressive in its precision is sent into students homes to spread approval or to mark exactly down to a single percentage point how dissatisfied with their children parents should be Although some people might be surprised how little time or reflection goes into making up these records the cumulative weight of the objective seeming documents establishes a profile of defect which compels a child to arrive at a certain decisions about himself and his future based on the casual judgment of strangers P Self evaluation the staple of every major philosophical system that ever appeared on the planet is never a factor in these things The lesson of report cards grades and tests is that children should not trust themselves or their parents but must rely on the evaluation of certified officials People need to be told what they are worth P b In lesson b six I teach children that they are being watched I keep each student under constant surveillance and so do my colleagues There are no private spaces for children there is no private time Class change lasts seconds to keep promiscuous fraternization at low levels Students are encouraged to tattle on each other even to tattle on their parents Of course I encourage parents to file their own child s waywardness too P I assign homework so that this surveillance extends into the household where students might otherwise use the time to learn something unauthorized perhaps from a father or mother or by apprenticing to some wiser person in the neighborhood P The lesson of constant surveillance is that no one can be trusted that privacy is not legitimate Surveillance is an ancient urgency among certain influential thinkers it was a central prescription set down by Calvin in the Institutes by Plato in the Republic by Hobbes by Comte by Francis Bacon All these childless men discovered the same thing Children must be closely watched if you want to keep a society under central control P b It is b the great triumph of schooling that among even the best of my fellow teachers and among even the best parents there is only a small number who can imagine a different way to do things Yet only a very few lifetimes ago things were different in the United States originality and variety were common currency our freedom from regimentation made us the miracle of the world social class boundaries were relatively easy to cross our citizenry was marvelously confident inventive and able to do many things independently to think for themselves We were something all by ourselves as individuals P It only takes about contact hours to transmit basic literacy and math skills well enough that kids can be self teachers from then on The cry for basic skills practice is a smokescreen behind which schools pre empt the time of children for twelve years and teach them the six lessons I ve just taught you P We ve had a society increasingly under central control in the United States since just before the Civil War the lives we lead the clothes we wear the food we eat and the green highway signs we drive by from coast to coast are the products of this central control So too I think are the epidemics of drugs suicide divorce violence cruelty and the hardening of class into caste in the U S products of the dehumanization of our lives the lessening of individual and family importance that central control imposes P Without a fully active role in community life you cannot develop into a complete human being Aristotle taught that Surely he was right look around you or look in the mirror that is the demonstration P School is an essential support system for a vision of social engineering that condemns most people to be subordinate stones in a pyramid that narrows to a control point as it ascends School is an artifice which makes such a pyramidal social order seem inevitable although such a premise is a fundamental betrayal of the American Revolution In colonial days and through the period of the early Republic we had no schools to speak of And yet the promise of democracy was beginning to be realized We turned our backs on this promise by bringing to life the ancient dream of Egypt compulsory training in subordination for everybody Compulsory schooling was the secret Plato reluctantly transmitted in the Republic when he laid down the plans for total state control of human life P b The current b debate about whether we should have a national curriculum is phony we already have one locked up in the six lessons I ve told you about and a few more I ve spared you This curriculum produces moral and intellectual paralysis and no curriculum of content will be sufficient to reverse its bad effects What is under discussion is a great irrelevancy P None of this is inevitable you know None of it is impregnable to change We do have a choice in how we bring up young people there is no right way There is no international competition that compels our existence difficult as it is to even think about in the face of a constant media barrage of myth to the contrary In every important material respect our nation is self sufficient If we gained a non material philosophy that found meaning where it is genuinely located in families friends the passage of seasons in nature in simple ceremonies and rituals in curiosity generosity compassion and service to others in a decent independence and privacy then we would be truly self sufficient P b How did b these awful places these schools come about As we know them they are a product of the two Red Scares of and when powerful interests feared a revolution among our industrial poor and partly they are the result of the revulsion with which old line families regarded the waves of Celtic Slavic and Latin immigration and the Catholic religion after And certainly a third contributing cause can be found in the revulsion with which these same families regarded the free movement of Africans through the society after the Civil War P Look again at the six lessons of school This is training for permanent underclasses people who are to be deprived forever of finding the center of their own special genius And it is training shaken loose from its original logic to regulate the poor Since the s the growth of the well articulated school bureaucracy and the less visible growth of a horde of industries that profit from schooling exactly as it is have enlarged schooling s original grasp to seize the sons and daughters of the middle class P Is it any wonder Socrates was outraged at the accusation that he took money to teach Even then philosophers saw clearly the inevitable direction the professionalization of teaching would take pre empting the teaching function that belongs to all in a healthy community belongs indeed most clearly to yourself since nobody else cares as much about your destiny Professional teaching tends to another serious error It makes things that are inherently easy to learn like reading writing and arithmetic difficult by insisting they be taught by pedagogical procedures P b With lessons b like the ones I teach day after day is it any wonder we have the national crisis we face today Young people indifferent to the adult world and to the future indifferent to almost everything except the diversion of toys and violence Rich or poor schoolchildren cannot concentrate on anything for very long They have a poor sense of time past and to come they are mistrustful of intimacy like the children of divorce they really are they hate solitude are cruel materialistic dependent passive violent timid in the face of the unexpected addicted to distraction P All the peripheral tendencies of childhood are magnified to a grotesque extent by schooling whose hidden curriculum prevents effective personality development Indeed without exploiting the fearfulness selfishness and inexperience of children our schools could not survive at all nor could I as a certified schoolteacher P Critical thinking is a term we hear frequently these days as a form of training which will herald a new day in mass schooling It certainly will if it ever happens No common school that actually dared teach the use of dialectic heuristic and other tools of free minds could last a year without being torn to pieces P Institutional schoolteachers are destructive to children s development Nobody survives the Six Lesson Curriculum unscathed not even the instructors The method is deeply and profoundly anti educational No tinkering will fix it In one of the great ironies of human affairs the massive rethinking that schools require would cost so much less than we are spending now that it is not likely to happen First and foremost the business I am in is a jobs project and a contract letting agency We cannot afford to save money not even to help children P b At the b pass we ve come to historically and after years of teaching I must conclude that one of the only alternatives on the horizon for most families is to teach their own children at home Small de institutionalized schools are another Some form of free market system for public schooling is the likeliest place to look for answers But the near impossibility of these things for the shattered families of the poor and for too many on the fringes of the economic middle class foretell that the disaster of Six Lesson Schools is likely to continue P After an adult lifetime spent in teaching school I believe the method of schooling is the only real content it has Don t be fooled into thinking that good curricula or good equipment or good teachers are the critical determinants of your son and daughter s schooltime All the pathologies we ve considered come about in large measure because the lessons of school prevent children from keeping important appointments with themselves and their families to learn lessons in self motivation perseverance self reliance courage dignity and love and of course lessons in service to others which are among the key lessons of home life P Thirty years ago these things could still be learned in the time left after school But television has eaten most of that time and a combination of television and the stresses peculiar to two income or single parent families have swallowed up most of what used to be family time Our kids have no time left to grow up fully human and only thin soil wastelands to do it in P b A future b is rushing down upon our culture which will insist that all of us learn the wisdom of non material experience this future will demand as the price of survival that we follow a pace of natural life economical in material cost These lessons cannot be learned in schools as they are School is like starting life with a year jail sentence in which bad habits are the only curriculum truly learned I teach school and win awards doing it I should know td td width td

Jerry Brown h h March h br p Jerry Brown Welcome to another edition of We The People this hour we re going to talk some more about learning education and schooling in its many variations To help us reflect more deeply on this question we have on a line from New York John Taylor Gatto he was named the New York Teacher of the Year in he was also named New York City Teacher of the Year in as well as He resigned from teaching during his state titled year and he s put out an op ed piece in the Wall St Journal and four months later he was honored by his former students in a program at Carnegie Hall called quot An Evening With John Taylor Gatto the Exhausted School quot He s written the book quot Dumbing Down the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schools quot p p So what should I call you not professor of course just John John welcome to the show Call me Jerry p p John Taylor Gatto Okay Governor I ll you Jerry p p Jerry Brown Ok It s a real pleasure I ve been reading some of your material and its certainly harkens back to a couple of major influences on my teaching or rather my school ideas one Ivan Illich and the other Paul Goodman I guess I got off the trail there in and I read the book quot Compulsory Mis education quot and I ve never quite been able to get the hang of school issues since p p John Taylor Gatto I know both of those writers and they ve had a big influence on me as well p p JB Well tell me John you ve been in the school business thirty odd years teaching in the public schools of New York so can you state here in the beginning what the problem is here with here People are just wringing their hands and it doesn t seem like anything is going to get better with the path that we re on p p JTG Well there s a lot of problems Jerry But I think they boil down to a quick slug of we don t teach the way children learn and because the business has become really a central part of the American economy you re really not allowed to teach the way children learn although any individual component in this system would admit privately that they wish they d allow you to do that You have the perfect example of that out your way an elderly Peruvian immigrant in a school near Los Angeles inside of four years had the best scores on the Advanced Placement Calculus Test I m sure he was an excellent teacher but that s really beside the point He was working with a group of kids with no mathematical tradition and very little literary tradition and inside of a short time Garfield High was the third ranking school in the US on the AP calculus Mr Escalante s fate is just fascinating he was harassed and hounded out the school They made it intolerable for him to stay p p In Chicago there s a black lady named Marva Collins working with black ghetto kids many of them with no intact families She found out what I found later on which was that these children have no resistance to very high level work and ideation In a quick take if you set the idiom aside they re producing work of a caliber that we associate with adults I know this must sound fantastic to your listeners but the truth is you and I could spend hours and not come to the end of people who ve accidentally stumbled on the great dirty secret of American schooling it just doesn t teach the way children learn nor can it be allowed to or maybe that s just momentum and not design We re dealing with a billion dollar a year industry it s the gatekeeper to all of the rest of the jobs We couldn t turn out an excess of competent people without really doing damage to this economy If this sounds like I m playing a conspiratorial string on my violin hardly the president of Columbia s teacher s college Dean Russell in in the keynote speech to the NEA said that there was a tremendous danger that too many leader s would be produced and it would cause a collapse in the system p p JB I m reading where a quote that you have in an article by you by Edward Roth in his book written in called quot Social Control quot says the following quot plans are on the way to replace community family and church with propaganda education and mass media People are only little plastic lumps of human dough quot Now you quote that I suppose because for you it encapsulates the underlying spirit of education in America p p JTG Yeah I actually used that in a book that s coming out in the summer called quot the Empty Child quot by Simon and Schuster Since they wouldn t give me the million words I needed I needed to find the most trenchant reflection of this attitude towards children that they re little plastic lumps of dough Roth of course is not just a professor of sociology he was one of the two or three people who created the American discipline of sociology And you also have a few years later Geddard of Princeton the head of the psychology department who said that standardized testing would function as a dunce cap making people aware of their inferiority making them reluctance to compete and even even reproduce themselves There s a current to this not a strain but a powerful central current right before the first world war reaching a tremendous visible crescendo sometime right after the second world war after which it disintegrated itself rather than provoking controversy as a duty thing and not talk about it p p I stumbled upon all of this while I was trying to figure out why on earth so many people appeared to have a vested interest in trying to stop me from doing what they knew worked in a school setting But I talked to each one of them individually they d admit that that quot its stupid but I have to do it because quot and then they d refer to the next highest person on the administrative ladder Eventually when we got the state education dept and I was able to talk to the people there they began referring to politicians not all politicians but certain politicians And when I spoke to some of their administrative assistants a few were honest enough to refer me to corps great foundations think tanks which were running this particular politician although this was hardly said but I heard that What we have done then displace authority over the lives of children into so many different hands many of those quite invisible that to approach this with a problem solving set of mind is really to frustrate yourself to death We re dealing with a system that s working exactly the way its supposed to work There are ways around that you can sabotage it like I did for many years and that works sometimes locally or parochially until you re caught You can sidestep it by sending your kids to some private schools but most private schools function the same way except that they re more cosmetic You can home school your children I mean they re a variety of ways around it but they re not all tackling the problem p p JB I want to ask you you said that anytime you do something that is right you get blocked Could you give me one example of what you did that was right and was blocked p p JTG Oh sure I ll give you the actual example that triggered my resignation and the op ed editorial in the wall street journal My school system that I continued to succeed in in the sense that my kids were succeeding including the kids that weren t supposed to succeed continued to move me into worse and worse school settings Until finally I ended up at the school that produced of the quot Central Park jogger quot rapists including a number of other distinctions And here using the essentially the same methods but it took a lot longer and I was an older man but using essentially the same methods the kids began to lose their quot kid quot quality and began to become people and have a vested interest in developing their minds and spirits and characters as far as they could When I saw this heartening response my method is then to offer more and more challenges and at some point a challenge to a kid is navigating in the adult world of reality that they see around them dimly p p I had arranged with the president of I ll call it quot Bell Telephone quot in New York to have my kids taken through to visit a telephone station in keeping with things that I had been doing for years At the moment that some executive was dispatched to pick up the kids at the school and take them to the station our principal raced to the door that very moment confronted me and said quot these kids can t go out they haven t filed the proper papers quot I said quot sure I did Jules I dropped those in your box hours ago quot He said quot the policies have changed it has to be done two week in advance sent to the district and approved quot And I said quot ok Jules the next time quot and he said quot No quot In front of some vice president of the phone company with the kids all assembled together At that point I realized that what happened was not an independent decision by the principal but rather a frantic attempt by the school district which happens to be on the Upper West Side of Manhattan In fact they were disturbed by the continued success of children who happened to be under my direction The truth is they could have been under anyone s direction who had followed the same sort of system dirt farmers would have followed years ago p p JB Now what did you do for the kids with the kids that triggered this kind of retaliatory response p p JTG Essentially I operated on a couple of really simple assumptions That this bizarre and disturbing behavior that kids not only poor kids but really prosperous kids in New York were producing was a direct result of their lives being stripped of significant experiences confined in these abstract cells for all of their natural youth and set a diet of low level abstractions Not even the challenging debate material or text that you would have find in a fourth or fifth grade in the middle of the th century I mean that stuff that is reserved for the quot gifted quot or quot talented quot kids The ones in high school are doing sixth or seventh grade work by a century ago s standards p p JB If I can read between the lines you deviated from the standard curriculum that the administration wanted p p JTG I put together what I call a quot guerrilla quot curriculum Jerry and that was composed of stuffing them with primary experiences as much as I could from an ad hoc basis when I would read the paper in the morning or the night before Any kind of news going on I would have advance permission and the kids would be dispatched to investigate One part of this was I brought a kind of seminar standard to the classroom We didn t have to understand I ll use Aristotle as an example we didn t have to understand everything Aristotle was driving at to be absolutely certain that a lively discussion shows that much of what he was driving at were current topics in kids minds Once they got over the barrier of the language gap which is extremely easy to do just like teaching reading is extremely easy to do California s example to the world notwithstanding p p JB OK So you got them into more challenging material in a way which would change based on day to day events in the environment The way the administration saw it this was not in the structure that the curriculum was designed but you get that this was the way to give reality and aliveness to the learning experience p p JTG You re quite right but I think that the dynamic at work is worth exploring because its not as simple as the administration opposing it What s happening is that each subordinate level that has to give permission is on thin ice So that the ball is passed and when the ball leaves the local precincts it s really passed between foundation project officers certain university staff policy people in Washington so that in fact the ball never returns to your court or when it does its invariably ringed around with so many restrictions by other people who are making a living I m not alleging that its conscious but it happens To the point that you don t want to do it anymore p p JB We re taking a break we re talking with John Taylor Gatto John when we get back I want you to comment on the curve marking on the curve in standardized testing as a way to imbed the growing inequality in our society This is Jerry Brown don t go away p p commercial break p p JB Would you comment on the idea that grading on the curve which I presume most schools do is a way to put in a type of bell curve social stratification that is increasingly being replicated in almost every part of America p p JTG The idea very very early on it comes out of Prussian Germany in a series of debates in the th debates that arose out of Prussia that essentially said a mathematical or mathematized predictable world is the best out of all possible things to hope for The big people to read if you ve read Hegel himself I think you d know all you d need to know In order to control everybody certain strategic courses were undertaken in forced schooling There had never been prior to Prussia in the early th century been successful forced schooling in the history of the planet And suddenly Prussia in drew in all of the children put them in a stage system The first stage was to trivialize the greatest learning time by filling it I realize that this is going to get the backs up of some of your listeners with balloons songs and funny games But to keep the intellectual moral part under the control of the teacher Somewhere in the age of the idea was to set everyone suddenly in competition with each other and produce visible marks of rank everyone so that no matter how secure you were in your understanding of something there would always be people you could see who had been visibly recognized as your masters And according to Hegel and a number of other thinkers this constant quot alienation quot that was the world they used which was translated directly to American schools this alimentation would lead to the kind of society which could be placed under the direction of certified experts that the state and the corporate world found safe and productive The net result of this Jerry was that Prussia a dirt poor country in or years was one of the world leaders The Prussian king decided the Canadian American border because he was the most prestigious monarch on earth Hartsman and every other founder of American schooling before we had compulsory schooling went to Prussia and came back with glowing reports of what the Prussians had produced that is to say a predictable society that could be run by the best minds p p What you see on a normal bell curve probably at a moment when assessment is the wrong thing to do its inappropriate people learn on private learning curves We know the point in which we cross the barrier and understand something Some people learn instantly certain things and others learn six years later I will tell you this a kid who learns to read at five and a kid who learns to read at will be indistinguishable to each other at the age of fourteen assuming they both like what they re doing On the other hand we can say its too inconvenient or too expensive to allow that and impose a learning curve in first grade that produces this wonderful bell we can then assign the people on the fringes of the bell to special ed and the people in the middle of the bells the walls of the curve to the dull classes and so on And we will create a class system by simply doing that Inside of a year or two the kids will impose that kind of class system on themselves It s a phenomenally intricate but rather easy to unravel puzzle there reading is pathetically easy to teach you assume that once you assemble people in a room and do it in the same routines that you ll fail to teach it to some of them that this bell will appear and the atmosphere in the classroom is that the humiliation of being a dull reader or bad reader will never wear off You can predict the rise of a giant remediation industry p p On the other hand I want your to compare it to or when the founder of the DuPont fortune wrote to investors in France and said there s a miracle going on in this country because everyone here can read and debate like a lawyer quot There s nobody who can t read and they re facile with numbers quot Or you can look at De Tocqueville s famous analysis when he said that the classical Greeks are children compared to these dirt farmer s kids Look at the best sellers of that day The Last of the Mohicans by James Fennimore Cooper I would urge your readers to get an uncut version of Last of the Mohicans especially if they have one or two college degrees and see what an impossible book it is to read And yet it sold the equivalent of million copies p p JB I notice that you re also saying that judging from the Army Intelligence Test that you have of the whites who can t read and of the African Americans who can t read p p JTG Its just amazing because just in these figures were just for the white group and for the African American group p p JB Do you believe John do you believe those numbers because they re very shocking Ouml p p JTG I believe those numbers from my own experience When you try to reconstruct the intellect of a tear old kid which is essentially what my classroom was about you re dealing with social resistance which is quite unbelievable yet I just got a call today from a kid who had criminal charges against him at and furthermore he was filed as a functional illiterate by the school He s working on his second college degree and trying to decide among offers which would make him leave academia This is a boy that wanted to have a gun at he s only about now So what miracle happened Well the miracle that happened was that he was given himself back and it didn t take a N Y teacher of the year to do that I m not claiming any particular insight other than what was common knowledge a century ago This country was unique in world history because it took ordinary people people who were considered trash in Europe and made them independent hard working self respecting people To deny what is unique about American history is just nuts because in there we have the skeleton key to unlock the problem of our schools p p JB My own grandmother I think went to school until the th grade she was quite a reader well into her s very well read Now we have a world in which this president is saying that we have to create a situation that everyone can have at least two years of college in the same way that I suppose that the th grade was assumed to be necessary at the beginning of the century p p JTG I hope that he s just a dupe Jerry I really hope so The way that the game works is that we say that the reason this problem exists is that A we don t have enough money and B we don t have enough of the kids lives to work on them So we ve watched schooling go from an average weeks and produce a totally literate nation p p JB weeks or years p p JTG weeks The truth is that nowhere in the US as late as nowhere did more than of the people go to school p p JB And when they went to school you re saying that they only went for weeks That s only a couple of months p p JTG And kids who went for longer than that didn t go every day or even every week So they came and went And furthermore they were under the control of one woman who had ages and class sizes of that s an impossible situation according to the way we do business today And yet as soon as you change the teacher student ratio from the teacher being of the solution and the student to the reverse of that the student of the solution the teacher then you can see how very large classes or mixed classes can work because the kids are responsible teaching each other p p JB What I m hearing here one of the key building blocks more important than TV in the development of a society of dependent obedient sheep like herdlike uncritical people is that the school is the mechanism of schooling enshrined as a secular religion So if the goal is independent thinking self reliance critical thinking all the good stuff that Abe Lincoln Benjamin Franklin held up as such important values then somehow this whole schooling mechanism needs to be smashed And I want to get that very clear because there is a childlike devotion to the school system that reminds me of the quot Devotion of the Blessed Mother quot at St Brendan s grammar school years ago p p JTG It was sold that way all of this the various media sold it this way I m not saying that there was a cabal but simply that it was the way it was presented to them Flattering luncheons where the decision has been made to take that wonderful woman who had run without an administration those one room schools which had done so well and put her under the direction of an apparatus of men not just a single layer but infinite layers which are still being spun out p p JB It almost sounds like the apparatchiks in the late stage Soviet Union p p JTG That s an excellent kernel The question is whether this grows naturally as a result of certain economic decision MIT makes mandatory I believe a book called quot Autonomous Technology quot by Langdon Winter written about years ago in which Winters says once you start with certain premises it is inevitable that the system will eventually control all the personnel the apparent leaders will remain only as long as they serve the system s purposes if they don t heir marginalized and gotten rid of and someone else is put in p p A lot of them that the family was the barrier to a sane future They may not have liked each other but they all agreed that you had to get children away from the family School was the mechanism to utopianize I think both things are at work here ideologues who communicate this idea and are able to perpetuate themselves from generation to generation They control hiring at universities and foundations and so on and look for people like themselves p p JB Today we get a report of Al Shanker s funeral a memorial Al Shanker being the head of the United Federation of Teachers of America probably the most powerful educator of this country And you have Senator Kennedy representing the Left wing of the remnant Democratic Party and you have former New York City mayor Ed Koch once a Democrat but now a populist corporatist conservative former New York mayor So you have a pretty wide spectrum at least on the left right spectrum giving real encomiums of adulation to the creative work of Shanker which as far as I know without speaking ill of the deceased Shanker was a pillar of this entire apparatus which you have been criticizing for the last minutes p p JTG He was Let me say not in Shanker s defense but an explanation of how Shanker managed to draw support from all portions of the political spectrum Shanker was to his credit very outspoken of the division that he represented Shanker is as close to being a classical old line socialist nor did he make any bones about that Shanker is on record a number of times saying that schools are not about the best destiny for the children schools are not about making Johnny s family stronger or bringing his parents in on the governance or deliberations I had dinner twice with Shanker I was at this small table with him and I must say that compared to everyone else at the table probably me included that Shanker absolutely said what was on his mind laughs Not that I agreed with him p p JB But that s the real issue what is on his mind and what s on America s mind is that the problem of America is that there is not enough education there s not enough getting to these poor people who are causing all of the crime or there s not enough in the middle to compete with the Japanese or the Chinese or all of those smart people And the answer is whether it s the market based people who have their strategy or the liberals who have theirs one way or another its to get these little kids more programs for the competitive world and not for the kind of disruptive individual critical thinking which I believe you re suggesting and that I certainly very much recommend p p break p p JB John I m going to read you something that you ve said and I m going to ask you how to attain what you re suggesting I quote quot We have to radically decentralize government corporate schooling return the power of designing and assessing programs to the local level and ensure that every form of training for the young aims at producing independent self reliant minds good characters and individuals who get fighting mad when called a quot human resource quot and told their main function is to be part of the work force Ok great I accept that so how do we get there Who do we attack and what do we build p p JTG The schema first has to be seen clearly as long as the economy is built up of very large corporations very large institutions and very large government agencies by necessity all the training that is approved leads towards some position on the pecking order of these giant employment pyramids I d like to jump from that to two groups who have never participated in that and who ve had a sort of blemished record of success I d like to do this to allow your listeners to independently verify that its possible p p Look at Johns Hopkins University not one of my favorite universities but they ve been tracking the Amish for a long time They ve published several I think mind blowing books about what has happened in Amish America In this century at the beginning of the century there were of these people now there are So the group itself has retained its integrity and grown times Second of the Amish or as close to that as humanly possible has independent livelihoods and its divided in small entrepreneurial businesses and in small farms Now consider the drawbacks these people labor under the government of Pennsylvania has been their sworn enemy through the century And they don t use telephones they don t use computers they don t use cars and they go to the sup th sup grade only because the Supreme Court cut a deal with them in the So with all these drawbacks you have a community that with all intents and purposes has no crime at all that takes care of old and young because it mixes both of those groups together in the life of the community is amazingly successful amazingly wealthy and amazingly unschooled Now many of your listeners or my friends who would no doubt say that it s that religious glue that pious glue that gives them the advantage So I d like to jump to the group that s resolutely militantly free thought probably as any that s ever existed p p And that s in the Basque country in Spain the north west of Spain and its forgive my accent the Mondragon Cooperative There s about the same number of these people as there are Amish and they aim for exactly the same grown up solution that everyone will have an independent livelihood or they ll be a part of a small group that makes its living proving to other people that it s valuable So their schooling is resolutely directed toward developing the kind of independent self reliant tough minded characteristics that oddly enough Amish education also stresses p p So here we have bracketed now two groups that are small but not that small who manage to keep what Lincoln s idea for America was Independent livelihood was where it was at You know back in the s s it was impossible to assemble an American work force over because people would only work for you long enough to get a little stake and then cut off and go off on their own When we look at the history of New England factories that they re going to concerts and dances and libraries for the young girls who worked there for just a couple of years until they could bring a little stake to their marriage That was the American dream that you could write the script to your own life And very very gradually that dream was converted and this is quite easy to track not by evil people but by people who understood that wealth depends on your ability to command labor And unless you can assemble large groups of labor you were never going to be wealthy as the Europeans reckoned wealth or the English reckoned wealth p p JB Ok John since we have a few callers on the line I d like to encapsulate what you re saying that the accumulation of great wealth requires the ability to command labor You cannot labor if its independent and critical therefore you need a schooling system much in the way that obedience school provides for dogs they have to be taught not to pee in the house or heel at their master s beck and call And in effect the entire school enterprise and there are obvious examples is a huge obedience school run on the kennel model And the two examples you ve given me Amish which is based on a character traditional very family based with a very god centered decentralized form and the other one which you refer to as secular is the worker owned cooperatives in the Basque land in Spain Two poles which are totally at variance with the consumer mass obedience operation which is cheerleaded from Jesse Jackson on the Left or Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan even more to the Left to you know the Right Wing folks the Moral Majority and the chamber of commerce p p So if I hear you right what we really have to face up to is the absolute need for a critical distancing from this whole status quo which seeps into our deepest aims p p JTG Absolutely that s a perfect abstract Notice that we can eliminate Marxist ideas that evil or venal people are doing this What is happened is that the people who are doing this have convinced themselves quot scientifically quot that this is the only that it can be This is what sociologist Thomas Malthus biologist Charles Darwin or chemist John Dalton all said This is what the book the Bell Curve a couple of years ago said This is the way wishes it to be it can t be any other way So they have to overlook Jaime Escalante in California or Marva Collins in Chicago or even John Taylor Gatto in New York They have to overlook the Basques they have to overlook the Amish because they don t fit that theory p p JB So John then I take it you have no objection to vouchers p p JTG Its not that I have no objection to vouchers there s a real danger built into vouchers and that is the same sort of surveillance over your kids lives will follow the voucher What we have to do and we re going to do it whether its allowed or now we have to begin to break the fealty to these enormous organizations whether they re government or corporate or institutions p p JB Ok let s take a few calls now Craig has been waiting go ahead Craig p p Craig Thank you for your recent programs with Susannah Shepherd and Grace Malone We are a home schooling family for many years and I guess in a sense I d like to explain why it is we home school I d like to start by recommending a book quot Teaching as a Subversive Activity quot by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner And I d would say that anyone who has an interest in this subject if you have not read that book consider yourself uneducated That book was written in didn t deal with home schooling but it does explains the need to raise children who do not just accept the unexamined assumptions of our society That impulse is out there across the country but its really at war against what seems to be a stronger approach to suppress that kind of approach I know there are exceptions there are good teachers who really want to educate kids in the truest sense of the term but they re fighting the system What I really want to say here is that the school system at its heart even though yes its their to in some sense to educate the children but at its heart its really there to break their spirits That is what I think all the time We ve had some experience with our own children for short periods of time at our local schools and its only confirmed and reinforced what we already thought we knew p p JB Thank you Craig very eloquent John p p JTG I d like to comment on what Craig said on breaking the spirit The most influential US commissioner of education that ever existed was William Torre Harris and in a book he wrote back in The Philosophy of Education he said that the purpose of schooling was to alienate children from their families their churches their neighborhoods and themselves I mean it wasn t a secret its just that people who walk their dogs or look at the sun come up in the morning they don t have time to read books called quot The Philosophy of Education quot laughs Of course that s what it s about p p JB Amazing p p JTG He was the only prominent school man who and I believe that s still true who was a house guest to the Rockefellers the Carnegies Harris brought German schooling to the US and made sure that it stuck p p JB All right let s take a call from Angel in New Jersey p p Angel Hi thank you both My question concerns what I seem to see as an apparent contradiction between the acknowledged purpose of the school systems as they now stand and the stated belief that they can in fact be altered without actually altering the primary purposes of society In other words with corporations wanting a docile work force with a government needing a military going overseas and to engage in practices that many would consider are against the very interests of the very people who are being asked to fight in that military why would you believe that under the current system that people who are in control of the schools ultimately the politicians would in fact want to change the system so that it would in fact produce critical thinkers p p JB Ok angel you ve just asked the question I think you re hitting it right on the head here you re going to need to change a lot more than just the schoolhouse p p JTG Angel let me speak to that One of the great ways that people are held in place by their own fear Because these enormous employment pyramids control the flow of money and even the flow of information around the whole country you might assume that nothing can be done about them The truth is they have almost no internal cohesion at all they hate each other Look how fast the soviet union came apart I would like to just tell you very quickly here that I sat with Jeane Kirkpatrick about two weeks before the first signs of the crack took place There were a few other people in the room and she said in that cold steely flinty voice of hers quot let me tell you that it won t be for a hundred years that you see a crack in the soviet union because they have a personal dossier of every citizen and they have mathematical ways of telling where the fault lines will appear quot And two weeks later of course it was dying and a short time after that it was dead p p JB Ok John John we ve got to break in One hour has gone by We ll do it again we ll do it again but we are out of time We ll come back to this topic again there s a lot more to dig in and there s a lot of people who want to talk about the public schools This is Jerry Brown for We the

Wake up H br By A href http www rheingold com Howard Rheingold a center p blockquote The relationship between the use of language and the induction of trance states might be one of the keys to understanding life in the last years of the technology millenium What if we re all in a trance and have been given hypnotic suggestions to ignore the evidence that we are in a trance As we stumble around bedazzled enormous machines eat the earth How would we treat people who try to tell us that we need to wake up Ask Charley Tart Ph D As Professor of Psychology at the University of California Davis where he has taught conducted research and written books for the past years Charles Tart Ph D qualifies as a tweedcoat and even a whitecoat He is a member in good standing of the science cult and his down to earth low key presentation lends an unexpected insider punch to his statements about the science cult s blind spots and every human s blind spots He thinks of himself as a scientist not a guru working in a field that is underpopulated despite it s importance It is underpopulated because research into consciousness is dangerous to an experimental psychologist s career and because it isn t easy to do the kind of research that can get the attention of the orthodoxy Tart s most recent book is Waking Up Overcoming the Obstacles to Human Potential You can contact Dr Tart via email a href mailto cttart ucdavis edu cttart ucdavis edu a p Howard Rheingold blockquote p br p br States of consciousness from altered states to the state earthlings call normal waking consciousness have been Charley Tart s specialty for two decades Surprisingly Dr Tart no longer calls it normal consciousness and has substituted what he feels to be a more accurate term consensus trance To him the idea of normal consciousness is the kind of convenient fiction illustrated by the famous folktale of the emperor s new clothes Together human groups agree on which of their perceptions should be admitted to awareness hence consensus then they train each other to see the world in that way and only in that way hence trance p In the s Tart s groundbreaking scientific articles about hypnosis and dreams appeared in psychological journals and in he published a collection of scientific articles Altered States of Consciousness bringing together laboratory studies of yogins analysis of the brain waves of Zenmasters research into hypnotically induced dreams lucid dreams mutual hypnosis and other borderlands of human consciousness that were beginning to attract scientific attention p By his account Charles Tart s childhood interest in his own vivid dream life a wondrous realm that everybody around him declared to be unreal was a factor in his decision to become a psychologist Each night in the dream state he discovered as all children do that he could visit magical kingdoms and do all manner of miraculous things And like all children when he told his parents about these dreams he was reminded that such experiences are figments of the imagination If all his nocturnal adventures were not considered to be legitimate reality to the adults he told about his dreams what was so special about being awake that made it more real And why do people when awake seem oblivious of the existence of that other magical realm of dream consciousness p Experimental psychology was the vehicle Tart chose to pursue his questions about consciousness and reality Although much of his early research involved dreaming he was attracted to the mysterious altered state of consciousness known as hypnosis Tart learned from his earliest experiences as a hypnotist that reality can be influenced far more strongly by one s state of mind than most people suspect most of the time p In inducing hypnosis I would sit down with a volunteer who wanted to be hypnotized Tart recalled We were presumably both normal people With our eyes we presumably saw the same room around us that others saw with our ears we presumably heard the ordinary sounds in the room We smelled what odors were there and felt the solidity of the real objects in the room p Then I began to talk to the subject Researchers give the style of talking the special name of hypnotic induction procedure but basically it was just talking The subject was given no drugs was not in a special environment had nothing external done to his brain and yet in twenty minutes I could drastically change the universe he lived in With a few words the subject could not lift his arm With a few more he heard voices talking when no one was there A few more words and he could open his eyes and see something that no one else could see or with the right suggestion a real object in plain sight in the room would be invisible to him p How can anybody distinguish then between dream hypnotic trance and reality Dehypnotization the procedure of breaking out of the normal human state of awareness according to both mystics and hypnotists is a matter of direct mental experience The method can be learned and that s the nutshell description of the esoteric wisdom of the ages p The clues from hypnosis research experiments into the influence of beliefs upon perceptions and teachings from the mystical traditions led Tart to see how normal waking consciousness is the product of a true hypnotic procedure that is practiced by parents teachers and peers reinforced by every social interaction and maintained by powerful taboos Consensus trance induction the process of learning the normal waking state of mind is involuntary and occurs under conditions that give it far more power than ordinary hypnotists are ever allowed When infants are first subjected to the processes that induce consensus trance they are all vulnerable and dependent upon their consensus hypnotists for their parents are the ones who initiate them into the rules of their culture according to the instructions that had been impressed upon them by their own parents teachers and peers p Among the techniques prohibited to ethical hypnotists but wielded effectively in the induction of consensus trance are the enormous amount of time devoted to the induction years to a lifetime the use of physical force emotional force love and validation guilt and the instinctive trust children have for their parents As they learn myriad versions of the right way to do things and the things not to do from their parents children build and continue to maintain a mental model of the world a filter on their reality lens that they learn to perceive everything through except partially in dreams The result leaves most people in an automatized daze It is a fundamental mistake of man s to think that he is alive when he has merely fallen asleep in life s waiting room is the way Idries Shah a contemporary exponent of ancient Middle Eastern mystical psychologies put it Seeker After Truth Octagon Press p If humans are indeed on the verge of realizing that we are caught in illusions while thinking we are perceiving reality how do we propose to escape The answer Tart has concluded could come in the form of mindfulness training a variety of exercises for elevating awareness by deliberately paying closer than usual attention to the mundane details of everyday life Gurdjieff called it self remembering and many flavors of psychotherapist East and West use it Mindfulness is a skill that can be honed by the right approach to what is happening right in front of you Be here now as internal gymnastics Working eating waiting for a traffic light to change can furnish opportunities for mindfulness Observe what you are feeling thinking perceiving don t get hung up on judging it just pay attention Tart thinks this kind of self observation noticing the automatization is the first step toward waking up p Why aren t the psychology departments of every major university working on the best ways to dehypnotize ourselves p We tend to think of consensus consciousness like a clearing in the wilderness Tart replied We don t know what monsters are out there We ve made a place that s comfortable and fortified and we are very ambivalent about leaving this little clearing for even a moment p Most of the world s major value systems Tart contends are based on an extraordinary state of consciousness on the part of a prophet or a group of people To Christians being born again is an altered state of consciousness Moses heard sacred instructions from a burning bush Mohammed received the Koran in a dream Buddha sat under a tree and woke up Most of the values that guide people s lives around the world today are derived from those extraordinary states of mind p If the sources of our values derive from altered states experiences and if we want to have some

table td width td td center H Charley Tart on Consensus Trance br lt SLAP gt lt SLAP gt Wake up H br By A href http www rheingold com Howard Rheingold a center p blockquote The relationship between the use of language and the induction of trance states might be one of the keys to understanding life in the last years of the technology millenium What if we re all in a trance and have been given hypnotic suggestions to ignore the evidence that we are in a trance As we stumble around bedazzled enormous machines eat the earth How would we treat people who try to tell us that we need to wake up Ask Charley Tart Ph D As Professor of Psychology at the University of California Davis where he has taught conducted research and written books for the past years Charles Tart Ph D qualifies as a tweedcoat and even a whitecoat He is a member in good standing of the science cult and his down to earth low key presentation lends an unexpected insider punch to his statements about the science cult s blind spots and every human s blind spots He thinks of himself as a scientist not a guru working in a field that is underpopulated despite it s importance It is underpopulated because research into consciousness is dangerous to an experimental psychologist s career and because it isn t easy to do the kind of research that can get the attention of the orthodoxy Tart s most recent book is Waking Up Overcoming the Obstacles to Human Potential You can contact Dr Tart via email a href mailto cttart ucdavis edu cttart ucdavis edu a p Howard Rheingold blockquote p br p br States of consciousness from altered states to the state earthlings call normal waking consciousness have been Charley Tart s specialty for two decades Surprisingly Dr Tart no longer calls it normal consciousness and has substituted what he feels to be a more accurate term consensus trance To him the idea of normal consciousness is the kind of convenient fiction illustrated by the famous folktale of the emperor s new clothes Together human groups agree on which of their perceptions should be admitted to awareness hence consensus then they train each other to see the world in that way and only in that way hence trance p In the s Tart s groundbreaking scientific articles about hypnosis and dreams appeared in psychological journals and in he published a collection of scientific articles Altered States of Consciousness bringing together laboratory studies of yogins analysis of the brain waves of Zenmasters research into hypnotically induced dreams lucid dreams mutual hypnosis and other borderlands of human consciousness that were beginning to attract scientific attention p By his account Charles Tart s childhood interest in his own vivid dream life a wondrous realm that everybody around him declared to be unreal was a factor in his decision to become a psychologist Each night in the dream state he discovered as all children do that he could visit magical kingdoms and do all manner of miraculous things And like all children when he told his parents about these dreams he was reminded that such experiences are figments of the imagination If all his nocturnal adventures were not considered to be legitimate reality to the adults he told about his dreams what was so special about being awake that made it more real And why do people when awake seem oblivious of the existence of that other magical realm of dream consciousness p Experimental psychology was the vehicle Tart chose to pursue his questions about consciousness and reality Although much of his early research involved dreaming he was attracted to the mysterious altered state of consciousness known as hypnosis Tart learned from his earliest experiences as a hypnotist that reality can be influenced far more strongly by one s state of mind than most people suspect most of the time p In inducing hypnosis I would sit down with a volunteer who wanted to be hypnotized Tart recalled We were presumably both normal people With our eyes we presumably saw the same room around us that others saw with our ears we presumably heard the ordinary sounds in the room We smelled what odors were there and felt the solidity of the real objects in the room p Then I began to talk to the subject Researchers give the style of talking the special name of hypnotic induction procedure but basically it was just talking The subject was given no drugs was not in a special environment had nothing external done to his brain and yet in twenty minutes I could drastically change the universe he lived in With a few words the subject could not lift his arm With a few more he heard voices talking when no one was there A few more words and he could open his eyes and see something that no one else could see or with the right suggestion a real object in plain sight in the room would be invisible to him p How can anybody distinguish then between dream hypnotic trance and reality Dehypnotization the procedure of breaking out of the normal human state of awareness according to both mystics and hypnotists is a matter of direct mental experience The method can be learned and that s the nutshell description of the esoteric wisdom of the ages p The clues from hypnosis research experiments into the influence of beliefs upon perceptions and teachings from the mystical traditions led Tart to see how normal waking consciousness is the product of a true hypnotic procedure that is practiced by parents teachers and peers reinforced by every social interaction and maintained by powerful taboos Consensus trance induction the process of learning the normal waking state of mind is involuntary and occurs under conditions that give it far more power than ordinary hypnotists are ever allowed When infants are first subjected to the processes that induce consensus trance they are all vulnerable and dependent upon their consensus hypnotists for their parents are the ones who initiate them into the rules of their culture according to the instructions that had been impressed upon them by their own parents teachers and peers p Among the techniques prohibited to ethical hypnotists but wielded effectively in the induction of consensus trance are the enormous amount of time devoted to the induction years to a lifetime the use of physical force emotional force love and validation guilt and the instinctive trust children have for their parents As they learn myriad versions of the right way to do things and the things not to do from their parents children build and continue to maintain a mental model of the world a filter on their reality lens that they learn to perceive everything through except partially in dreams The result leaves most people in an automatized daze It is a fundamental mistake of man s to think that he is alive when he has merely fallen asleep in life s waiting room is the way Idries Shah a contemporary exponent of ancient Middle Eastern mystical psychologies put it Seeker After Truth Octagon Press p If humans are indeed on the verge of realizing that we are caught in illusions while thinking we are perceiving reality how do we propose to escape The answer Tart has concluded could come in the form of mindfulness training a variety of exercises for elevating awareness by deliberately paying closer than usual attention to the mundane details of everyday life Gurdjieff called it self remembering and many flavors of psychotherapist East and West use it Mindfulness is a skill that can be honed by the right approach to what is happening right in front of you Be here now as internal gymnastics Working eating waiting for a traffic light to change can furnish opportunities for mindfulness Observe what you are feeling thinking perceiving don t get hung up on judging it just pay attention Tart thinks this kind of self observation noticing the automatization is the first step toward waking up p Why aren t the psychology departments of every major university working on the best ways to dehypnotize ourselves p We tend to think of consensus consciousness like a clearing in the wilderness Tart replied We don t know what monsters are out there We ve made a place that s comfortable and fortified and we are very ambivalent about leaving this little clearing for even a moment p Most of the world s major value systems Tart contends are based on an extraordinary state of consciousness on the part of a prophet or a group of people To Christians being born again is an altered state of consciousness Moses heard sacred instructions from a burning bush Mohammed received the Koran in a dream Buddha sat under a tree and woke up Most of the values that guide people s lives around the world today are derived from those extraordinary states of mind p If the sources of our values derive from altered states experiences and if we want to have some intelligent control of our destiny we d better not define these states out of existence They are the vital sources of life and culture and if we don t really understand altered states we re going to live a very dispirited life p I asked him if he sees a way out of this dilemma of self reinforcing institutional and individual trancemanship p Yes I do he replied We are indoctrinated to believe that intellect is what makes humans great and emotions are primitive leftovers from our jungle ancestors that interfere with our marvelous logical minds It is possible to train people to base decisions on the appropriate mixture of emotional intellectual and body

re going to talk some more about learning education and schooling in its many variations To help us reflect more deeply on this question we have on a line from New York John Taylor Gatto he was named the New York Teacher of the Year in he was also named New York City Teacher of the Year in as well as He resigned from teaching during his state titled year and he s put out an op ed piece in the Wall St Journal and four months later he was honored by his former students in a program at Carnegie Hall called quot An Evening With John Taylor Gatto the Exhausted School quot He s written the book quot Dumbing Down the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schools quot p p So what should I call you not professor of course just John John welcome to the show Call me Jerry p p John Taylor Gatto Okay Governor I ll you Jerry p p Jerry Brown Ok It s a real pleasure I ve been reading some of your material and its certainly harkens back to a couple of major influences on my teaching or rather my school ideas one Ivan Illich and the other Paul Goodman I guess I got off the trail there in and I read the book quot Compulsory Mis education quot and I ve never quite been able to get the hang of school issues since p p John Taylor Gatto I know both of those writers and they ve had a big influence on me as well p p JB Well tell me John you ve been in the school business thirty odd years teaching in the public schools of New York so can you state here in the beginning what the problem is here with here People are just wringing their hands and it doesn t seem like anything is going to get better with the path that we re on p p JTG Well there s a lot of problems Jerry But I think they boil down to a quick slug of we don t teach the way children learn and because the business has become really a central part of the American economy you re really not allowed to teach the way children learn although any individual component in this system would admit privately that they wish they d allow you to do that You have the perfect example of that out your way an elderly Peruvian immigrant in a school near Los Angeles inside of four years had the best scores on the Advanced Placement Calculus Test I m sure he was an excellent teacher but that s really beside the point He was working with a group of kids with no mathematical tradition and very little literary tradition and inside of a short time Garfield High was the third ranking school in the US on the AP calculus Mr Escalante s fate is just fascinating he was harassed and hounded out the school They made it intolerable for him to stay p p In Chicago there s a black lady named Marva Collins working with black ghetto kids many of them with no intact families She found out what I found later on which was that these children have no resistance to very high level work and ideation In a quick take if you set the idiom aside they re producing work of a caliber that we associate with adults I know this must sound fantastic to your listeners but the truth is you and I could spend hours and not come to the end of people who ve accidentally stumbled on the great dirty secret of American schooling it just doesn t teach the way children learn nor can it be allowed to or maybe that s just momentum and not design We re dealing with a billion dollar a year industry it s the gatekeeper to all of the rest of the jobs We couldn t turn out an excess of competent people without really doing damage to this economy If this sounds like I m playing a conspiratorial string on my violin hardly the president of Columbia s teacher s college Dean Russell in in the keynote speech to the NEA said that there was a tremendous danger that too many leader s would be produced and it would cause a collapse in the system p p JB I m reading where a quote that you have in an article by you by Edward Roth in his book written in called quot Social Control quot says the following quot plans are on the way to replace community family and church with propaganda education and mass media People are only little plastic lumps of human dough quot Now you quote that I suppose because for you it encapsulates the underlying spirit of education in America p p JTG Yeah I actually used that in a book that s coming out in the summer called quot the Empty Child quot by Simon and Schuster Since they wouldn t give me the million words I needed I needed to find the most trenchant reflection of this attitude towards children that they re little plastic lumps of dough Roth of course is not just a professor of sociology he was one of the two or three people who created the American discipline of sociology And you also have a few years later Geddard of Princeton the head of the psychology department who said that standardized testing would function as a dunce cap making people aware of their inferiority making them reluctance to compete and even even reproduce themselves There s a current to this not a strain but a powerful central current right before the first world war reaching a tremendous visible crescendo sometime right after the second world war after which it disintegrated itself rather than provoking controversy as a duty thing and not talk about it p p I stumbled upon all of this while I was trying to figure out why on earth so many people appeared to have a vested interest in trying to stop me from doing what they knew worked in a school setting But I talked to each one of them individually they d admit that that quot its stupid but I have to do it because quot and then they d refer to the next highest person on the administrative ladder Eventually when we got the state education dept and I was able to talk to the people there they began referring to politicians not all politicians but certain politicians And when I spoke to some of their administrative assistants a few were honest enough to refer me to corps great foundations think tanks which were running this particular politician although this was hardly said but I heard that What we have done then displace authority over the lives of children into so many different hands many of those quite invisible that to approach this with a problem solving set of mind is really to frustrate yourself to death We re dealing with a system that s working exactly the way its supposed to work There are ways around that you can sabotage it like I did for many years and that works sometimes locally or parochially until you re caught You can sidestep it by sending your kids to some private schools but most private schools function the same way except that they re more cosmetic You can home school your children I mean they re a variety of ways around it but they re not all tackling the problem p p JB I want to ask you you said that anytime you do something that is right you get blocked Could you give me one example of what you did that was right and was blocked p p JTG Oh sure I ll give you the actual example that triggered my resignation and the op ed editorial in the wall street journal My school system that I continued to succeed in in the sense that my kids were succeeding including the kids that weren t supposed to succeed continued to move me into worse and worse school settings Until finally I ended up at the school that produced of the quot Central Park jogger quot rapists including a number of other distinctions And here using the essentially the same methods but it took a lot longer and I was an older man but using essentially the same methods the kids began to lose their quot kid quot quality and began to become people and have a vested interest in developing their minds and spirits and characters as far as they could When I saw this heartening response my method is then to offer more and more challenges and at some point a challenge to a kid is navigating in the adult world of reality that they see around them dimly p p I had arranged with the president of I ll call it quot Bell Telephone quot in New York to have my kids taken through to visit a telephone station in keeping with things that I had been doing for years At the moment that some executive was dispatched to pick up the kids at the school and take them to the station our principal raced to the door that very moment confronted me and said quot these kids can t go out they haven t filed the proper papers quot I said quot sure I did Jules I dropped those in your box hours ago quot He said quot the policies have changed it has to be done two week in advance sent to the district and approved quot And I said quot ok Jules the next time quot and he said quot No quot In front of some vice president of the phone company with the kids all assembled together At that point I realized that what happened was not an independent decision by the principal but rather a frantic attempt by the school district which happens to be on the Upper West Side of Manhattan In fact they were disturbed by the continued success of children who happened to be under my direction The truth is they could have been under anyone s direction who had followed the same sort of system dirt farmers would have followed years ago p p JB Now what did you do for the kids with the kids that triggered this kind of retaliatory response p p JTG Essentially I operated on a couple of really simple assumptions That this bizarre and disturbing behavior that kids not only poor kids but really prosperous kids in New York were producing was a direct result of their lives being stripped of significant experiences confined in these abstract cells for all of their natural youth and set a diet of low level abstractions Not even the challenging debate material or text that you would have find in a fourth or fifth grade in the middle of the th century I mean that stuff that is reserved for the quot gifted quot or quot talented quot kids The ones in high school are doing sixth or seventh grade work by a century ago s standards p p JB If I can read between the lines you deviated from the standard curriculum that the administration wanted p p JTG I put together what I call a quot guerrilla quot curriculum Jerry and that was composed of stuffing them with primary experiences as much as I could from an ad hoc basis when I would read the paper in the morning or the night before Any kind of news going on I would have advance permission and the kids would be dispatched to investigate One part of this was I brought a kind of seminar standard to the classroom We didn t have to understand I ll use Aristotle as an example we didn t have to understand everything Aristotle was driving at to be absolutely certain that a lively discussion shows that much of what he was driving at were current topics in kids minds Once they got over the barrier of the language gap which is extremely easy to do just like teaching reading is extremely easy to do California s example to the world notwithstanding p p JB OK So you got them into more challenging material in a way which would change based on day to day events in the environment The way the administration saw it this was not in the structure that the curriculum was designed but you get that this was the way to give reality and aliveness to the learning experience p p JTG You re quite right but I think that the dynamic at work is worth exploring because its not as simple as the administration opposing it What s happening is that each subordinate level that has to give permission is on thin ice So that the ball is passed and when the ball leaves the local precincts it s really passed between foundation project officers certain university staff policy people in Washington so that in fact the ball never returns to your court or when it does its invariably ringed around with so many restrictions by other people who are making a living I m not alleging that its conscious but it happens To the point that you don t want to do it anymore p p JB We re taking a break we re talking with John Taylor Gatto John when we get back I want you to comment on the curve marking on the curve in standardized testing as a way to imbed the growing inequality in our society This is Jerry Brown don t go away p p commercial break p p JB Would you comment on the idea that grading on the curve which I presume most schools do is a way to put in a type of bell curve social stratification that is increasingly being replicated in almost every part of America p p JTG The idea very very early on it comes out of Prussian Germany in a series of debates in the th debates that arose out of Prussia that essentially said a mathematical or mathematized predictable world is the best out of all possible things to hope for The big people to read if you ve read Hegel himself I think you d know all you d need to know In order to control everybody certain strategic courses were undertaken in forced schooling There had never been prior to Prussia in the early th century been successful forced schooling in the history of the planet And suddenly Prussia in drew in all of the children put them in a stage system The first stage was to trivialize the greatest learning time by filling it I realize that this is going to get the backs up of some of your listeners with balloons songs and funny games But to keep the intellectual moral part under the control of the teacher Somewhere in the age of the idea was to set everyone suddenly in competition with each other and produce visible marks of rank everyone so that no matter how secure you were in your understanding of something there would always be people you could see who had been visibly recognized as your masters And according to Hegel and a number of other thinkers this constant quot alienation quot that was the world they used which was translated directly to American schools this alimentation would lead to the kind of society which could be placed under the direction of certified experts that the state and the corporate world found safe and productive The net result of this Jerry was that Prussia a dirt poor country in or years was one of the world leaders The Prussian king decided the Canadian American border because he was the most prestigious monarch on earth Hartsman and every other founder of American schooling before we had compulsory schooling went to Prussia and came back with glowing reports of what the Prussians had produced that is to say a predictable society that could be run by the best minds p p What you see on a normal bell curve probably at a moment when assessment is the wrong thing to do its inappropriate people learn on private learning curves We know the point in which we cross the barrier and understand something Some people learn instantly certain things and others learn six years later I will tell you this a kid who learns to read at five and a kid who learns to read at will be indistinguishable to each other at the age of fourteen assuming they both like what they re doing On the other hand we can say its too inconvenient or too expensive to allow that and impose a learning curve in first grade that produces this wonderful bell we can then assign the people on the fringes of the bell to special ed and the people in the middle of the bells the walls of the curve to the dull classes and so on And we will create a class system by simply doing that Inside of a year or two the kids will impose that kind of class system on themselves It s a phenomenally intricate but rather easy to unravel puzzle there reading is pathetically easy to teach you assume that once you assemble people in a room and do it in the same routines that you ll fail to teach it to some of them that this bell will appear and the atmosphere in the classroom is that the humiliation of being a dull reader or bad reader will never wear off You can predict the rise of a giant remediation industry p p On the other hand I want your to compare it to or when the founder of the DuPont fortune wrote to investors in France and said there s a miracle going on in this country because everyone here can read and debate like a lawyer quot There s nobody who can t read and they re facile with numbers quot Or you can look at De Tocqueville s famous analysis when he said that the classical Greeks are children compared to these dirt farmer s kids Look at the best sellers of that day The Last of the Mohicans by James Fennimore Cooper I would urge your readers to get an uncut version of Last of the Mohicans especially if they have one or two college degrees and see what an impossible book it is to read And yet it sold the equivalent of million copies p p JB I notice that you re also saying that judging from the Army Intelligence Test that you have of the whites who can t read and of the African Americans who can t read p p JTG Its just amazing because just in these figures were just for the white group and for the African American group p p JB Do you believe John do you believe those numbers because they re very shocking Ouml p p JTG I believe those numbers from my own experience When you try to reconstruct the intellect of a tear old kid which is essentially what my classroom was about you re dealing with social resistance which is quite unbelievable yet I just got a call today from a kid who had criminal charges against him at and furthermore he was filed as a functional illiterate by the school He s working on his second college degree and trying to decide among offers which would make him leave academia This is a boy that wanted to have a gun at he s only about now So what miracle happened Well the miracle that happened was that he was given himself back and it didn t take a N Y teacher of the year to do that I m not claiming any particular insight other than what was common knowledge a century ago This country was unique in world history because it took ordinary people people who were considered trash in Europe and made them independent hard working self respecting people To deny what is unique about American history is just nuts because in there we have the skeleton key to unlock the problem of our schools p p JB My own grandmother I think went to school until the th grade she was quite a reader well into her s very well read Now we have a world in which this president is saying that we have to create a situation that everyone can have at least two years of college in the same way that I suppose that the th grade was assumed to be necessary at the beginning of the century p p JTG I hope that he s just a dupe Jerry I really hope so The way that the game works is that we say that the reason this problem exists is that A we don t have enough money and B we don t have enough of the kids lives to work on them So we ve watched schooling go from an average weeks and produce a totally literate nation p p JB weeks or years p p JTG weeks The truth is that nowhere in the US as late as nowhere did more than of the people go to school p p JB And when they went to school you re saying that they only went for weeks That s only a couple of months p p JTG And kids who went for longer than that didn t go every day or even every week So they came and went And furthermore they were under the control of one woman who had ages and class sizes of that s an impossible situation according to the way we do business today And yet as soon as you change the teacher student ratio from the teacher being of the solution and the student to the reverse of that the student of the solution the teacher then you can see how very large classes or mixed classes can work because the kids are responsible teaching each other p p JB What I m hearing here one of the key building blocks more important than TV in the development of a society of dependent obedient sheep like herdlike uncritical people is that the school is the mechanism of schooling enshrined as a secular religion So if the goal is independent thinking self reliance critical thinking all the good stuff that Abe Lincoln Benjamin Franklin held up as such important values then somehow this whole schooling mechanism needs to be smashed And I want to get that very clear because there is a childlike devotion to the school system that reminds me of the quot Devotion of the Blessed Mother quot at St Brendan s grammar school years ago p p JTG It was sold that way all of this the various media sold it this way I m not saying that there was a cabal but simply that it was the way it was presented to them Flattering luncheons where the decision has been made to take that wonderful woman who had run without an administration those one room schools which had done so well and put her under the direction of an apparatus of men not just a single layer but infinite layers which are still being spun out p p JB It almost sounds like the apparatchiks in the late stage Soviet Union p p JTG That s an excellent kernel The question is whether this grows naturally as a result of certain economic decision MIT makes mandatory I believe a book called quot Autonomous Technology quot by Langdon Winter written about years ago in which Winters says once you start with certain premises it is inevitable that the system will eventually control all the personnel the apparent leaders will remain only as long as they serve the system s purposes if they don t heir marginalized and gotten rid of and someone else is put in p p A lot of them that the family was the barrier to a sane future They may not have liked each other but they all agreed that you had to get children away from the family School was the mechanism to utopianize I think both things are at work here ideologues who communicate this idea and are able to perpetuate themselves from generation to generation They control hiring at universities and foundations and so on and look for people like themselves p p JB Today we get a report of Al Shanker s funeral a memorial Al Shanker being the head of the United Federation of Teachers of America probably the most powerful educator of this country And you have Senator Kennedy representing the Left wing of the remnant Democratic Party and you have former New York City mayor Ed Koch once a Democrat but now a populist corporatist conservative former New York mayor So you have a pretty wide spectrum at least on the left right spectrum giving real encomiums of adulation to the creative work of Shanker which as far as I know without speaking ill of the deceased Shanker was a pillar of this entire apparatus which you have been criticizing for the last minutes p p JTG He was Let me say not in Shanker s defense but an explanation of how Shanker managed to draw support from all portions of the political spectrum Shanker was to his credit very outspoken of the division that he represented Shanker is as close to being a classical old line socialist nor did he make any bones about that Shanker is on record a number of times saying that schools are not about the best destiny for the children schools are not about making Johnny s family stronger or bringing his parents in on the governance or deliberations I had dinner twice with Shanker I was at this small table with him and I must say that compared to everyone else at the table probably me included that Shanker absolutely said what was on his mind laughs Not that I agreed with him p p JB But that s the real issue what is on his mind and what s on America s mind is that the problem of America is that there is not enough education there s not enough getting to these poor people who are causing all of the crime or there s not enough in the middle to compete with the Japanese or the Chinese or all of those smart people And the answer is whether it s the market based people who have their strategy or the liberals who have theirs one way or another its to get these little kids more programs for the competitive world and not for the kind of disruptive individual critical thinking which I believe you re suggesting and that I certainly very much recommend p p break p p JB John I m going to read you something that you ve said and I m going to ask you how to attain what you re suggesting I quote quot We have to radically decentralize government corporate schooling return the power of designing and assessing programs to the local level and ensure that every form of training for the young aims at producing independent self reliant minds good characters and individuals who get fighting mad when called a quot human resource quot and told their main function is to be part of the work force Ok great I accept that so how do we get there Who do we attack and what do we build p p JTG The schema first has to be seen clearly as long as the economy is built up of very large corporations very large institutions and very large government agencies by necessity all the training that is approved leads towards some position on the pecking order of these giant employment pyramids I d like to jump from that to two groups who have never participated in that and who ve had a sort of blemished record of success I d like to do this to allow your listeners to independently verify that its possible p p Look at Johns Hopkins University not one of my favorite universities but they ve been tracking the Amish for a long time They ve published several I think mind blowing books about what has happened in Amish America In this century at the beginning of the century there were of these people now there are So the group itself has retained its integrity and grown times Second of the Amish or as close to that as humanly possible has independent livelihoods and its divided in small entrepreneurial businesses and in small farms Now consider the drawbacks these people labor under the government of Pennsylvania has been their sworn enemy through the century And they don t use telephones they don t use computers they don t use cars and they go to the sup th sup grade only because the Supreme Court cut a deal with them in the So with all these drawbacks you have a community that with all intents and purposes has no crime at all that takes care of old and young because it mixes both of those groups together in the life of the community is amazingly successful amazingly wealthy and amazingly unschooled Now many of your listeners or my friends who would no doubt say that it s that religious glue that pious glue that gives them the advantage So I d like to jump to the group that s resolutely militantly free thought probably as any that s ever existed p p And that s in the Basque country in Spain the north west of Spain and its forgive my accent the Mondragon Cooperative There s about the same number of these people as there are Amish and they aim for exactly the same grown up solution that everyone will have an independent livelihood or they ll be a part of a small group that makes its living proving to other people that it s valuable So their schooling is resolutely directed toward developing the kind of independent self reliant tough minded characteristics that oddly enough Amish education also stresses p p So here we have bracketed now two groups that are small but not that small who manage to keep what Lincoln s idea for America was Independent livelihood was where it was at You know back in the s s it was impossible to assemble an American work force over because people would only work for you long enough to get a little stake and then cut off and go off on their own When we look at the history of New England factories that they re going to concerts and dances and libraries for the young girls who worked there for just a couple of years until they could bring a little stake to their marriage That was the American dream that you could write the script to your own life And very very gradually that dream was converted and this is quite easy to track not by evil people but by people who understood that wealth depends on your ability to command labor And unless you can assemble large groups of labor you were never going to be wealthy as the Europeans reckoned wealth or the English reckoned wealth p p JB Ok John since we have a few callers on the line I d like to encapsulate what you re saying that the accumulation of great wealth requires the ability to command labor You cannot labor if its independent and critical therefore you need a schooling system much in the way that obedience school provides for dogs they have to be taught not to pee in the house or heel at their master s beck and call And in effect the entire school enterprise and there are obvious examples is a huge obedience school run on the kennel model And the two examples you ve given me Amish which is based on a character traditional very family based with a very god centered decentralized form and the other one which you refer to as secular is the worker owned cooperatives in the Basque land in Spain Two poles which are totally at variance with the consumer mass obedience operation which is cheerleaded from Jesse Jackson on the Left or Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan even more to the Left to you know the Right Wing folks the Moral Majority and the chamber of commerce p p So if I hear you right what we really have to face up to is the absolute need for a critical distancing from this whole status quo which seeps into our deepest aims p p JTG Absolutely that s a perfect abstract Notice that we can eliminate Marxist ideas that evil or venal people are doing this What is happened is that the people who are doing this have convinced themselves quot scientifically quot that this is the only that it can be This is what sociologist Thomas Malthus biologist Charles Darwin or chemist John Dalton all said This is what the book the Bell Curve a couple of years ago said This is the way wishes it to be it can t be any other way So they have to overlook Jaime Escalante in California or Marva Collins in Chicago or even John Taylor Gatto in New York They have to overlook the Basques they have to overlook the Amish because they don t fit that theory p p JB So John then I take it you have no objection to vouchers p p JTG Its not that I have no objection to vouchers there s a real danger built into vouchers and that is the same sort of surveillance over your kids lives will follow the voucher What we have to do and we re going to do it whether its allowed or now we have to begin to break the fealty to these enormous organizations whether they re government or corporate or institutions p p JB Ok let s take a few calls now Craig has been waiting go ahead Craig p p Craig Thank you for your recent programs with Susannah Shepherd and Grace Malone We are a home schooling family for many years and I guess in a sense I d like to explain why it is we home school I d like to start by recommending a book quot Teaching as a Subversive Activity quot by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner And I d would say that anyone who has an interest in this subject if you have not read that book consider yourself uneducated That book was written in didn t deal with home schooling but it does explains the need to raise children who do not just accept the unexamined assumptions of our society That impulse is out there across the country but its really at war against what seems to be a stronger approach to suppress that kind of approach I know there are exceptions there are good teachers who really want to educate kids in the truest sense of the term but they re fighting the system What I really want to say here is that the school system at its heart even though yes its their to in some sense to educate the children but at its heart its really there to break their spirits That is what I think all the time We ve had some experience with our own children for short periods of time at our local schools and its only confirmed and reinforced what we already thought we knew p p JB Thank you Craig very eloquent John p p JTG I d like to comment on what Craig said on breaking the spirit The most influential US commissioner of education that ever existed was William Torre Harris and in a book he wrote back in The Philosophy of Education he said that the purpose of schooling was to alienate children from their families their churches their neighborhoods and themselves I mean it wasn t a secret its just that people who walk their dogs or look at the sun come up in the morning they don t have time to read books called quot The Philosophy of Education quot laughs Of course that s what it s about p p JB Amazing p p JTG He was the only prominent school man who and I believe that s still true who was a house guest to the Rockefellers the Carnegies Harris brought German schooling to the US and made sure that it stuck p p JB All right let s take a call from Angel in New Jersey p p Angel Hi thank you both My question concerns what I seem to see as an apparent contradiction between the acknowledged purpose of the school systems as they now stand and the stated belief that they can in fact be altered without actually altering the primary purposes of society In other words with corporations wanting a docile work force with a government needing a military going overseas and to engage in practices that many would consider are against the very interests of the very people who are being asked to fight in that military why would you believe that under the current system that people who are in control of the schools ultimately the politicians would in fact want to change the system so that it would in fact produce critical thinkers p p JB Ok angel you ve just asked the question I think you re hitting it right on the head here you re going to need to change a lot more than just the schoolhouse p p JTG Angel let me speak to that One of the great ways that people are held in place by their own fear Because these enormous employment pyramids control the flow of money and even the flow of information around the whole country you might assume that nothing can be done about them The truth is they have almost no internal cohesion at all they hate each other Look how fast the soviet union came apart I would like to just tell you very quickly here that I sat with Jeane Kirkpatrick about two weeks before the first signs of the crack took place There were a few other people in the room and she said in that cold steely flinty voice of hers quot let me tell you that it won t be for a hundred years that you see a crack in the soviet union because they have a personal dossier of every citizen and they have mathematical ways of telling where the fault lines will appear quot And two weeks later of course it was dying and a short time after that it was dead p p JB Ok John John we ve got to break in One hour has gone by We ll do it again we ll do it again but we are out of time We ll come back to this topic again there s a lot more to dig in and there s a lot of people who want to talk about the public schools This is Jerry Brown for We the People thanks for

href archivestyle css head body h John Taylor Gatto br New York State Teacher of the Year Interview By Jerry Brown h h March h br p Jerry Brown Welcome to another edition of We The People this hour we re going to talk some more about learning education and schooling in its many variations To help us reflect more deeply on this question we have on a line from New York John Taylor Gatto he was named the New York Teacher of the Year in he was also named New York City Teacher of the Year in as well as He resigned from teaching during his state titled year and he s put out an op ed piece in the Wall St Journal and four months later he was honored by his former students in a program at Carnegie Hall called quot An Evening With John Taylor Gatto the Exhausted School quot He s written the book quot Dumbing Down the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schools quot p p So what should I call you not professor of course just John John welcome to the show Call me Jerry p p John Taylor Gatto Okay Governor I ll you Jerry p p Jerry Brown Ok It s a real pleasure I ve been reading some of your material and its certainly harkens back to a couple of major influences on my teaching or rather my school ideas one Ivan Illich and the other Paul Goodman I guess I got off the trail there in and I read the book quot Compulsory Mis education quot and I ve never quite been able to get the hang of school issues since p p John Taylor Gatto I know both of those writers and they ve had a big influence on me as well p p JB Well tell me John you ve been in the school business thirty odd years teaching in the public schools of New York so can you state here in the beginning what the problem is here with here People are just wringing their hands and it doesn t seem like anything is going to get better with the path that we re on p p JTG Well there s a lot of problems Jerry But I think they boil down to a quick slug of we don t teach the way children learn and because the business has become really a central part of the American economy you re really not allowed to teach the way children learn although any individual component in this system would admit privately that they wish they d allow you to do that You have the perfect example of that out your way an elderly Peruvian immigrant in a school near Los Angeles inside of four years had the best scores on the Advanced Placement Calculus Test I m sure he was an excellent teacher but that s really beside the point He was working with a group of kids with no mathematical tradition and very little literary tradition and inside of a short time Garfield High was the third ranking school in the US on the AP calculus Mr Escalante s fate is just fascinating he was harassed and hounded out the school They made it intolerable for him to stay p p In Chicago there s a black lady named Marva Collins working with black ghetto kids many of them with no intact families She found out what I found later on which was that these children have no resistance to very high level work and ideation In a quick take if you set the idiom aside they re producing work of a caliber that we associate with adults I know this must sound fantastic to your listeners but the truth is you and I could spend hours and not come to the end of people who ve accidentally stumbled on the great dirty secret of American schooling it just doesn t teach the way children learn nor can it be allowed to or maybe that s just momentum and not design We re dealing with a billion dollar a year industry it s the gatekeeper to all of the rest of the jobs We couldn t turn out an excess of competent people without really doing damage to this economy If this sounds like I m playing a conspiratorial string on my violin hardly the president of Columbia s teacher s college Dean Russell in in the keynote speech to the NEA said that there was a tremendous danger that too many leader s would be produced and it would cause a collapse in the system p p JB I m reading where a quote that you have in an article by you by Edward Roth in his book written in called quot Social Control quot says the following quot plans are on the way to replace community family and church with propaganda education and mass media People are only little plastic lumps of human dough quot Now you quote that I suppose because for you it encapsulates the underlying spirit of education in America p p JTG Yeah I actually used that in a book that s coming out in the summer called quot the Empty Child quot by Simon and Schuster Since they wouldn t give me the million words I needed I needed to find the most trenchant reflection of this attitude towards children that they re little plastic lumps of dough Roth of course is not just a professor of sociology he was one of the two or three people who created the American discipline of sociology And you also have a few years later Geddard of Princeton the head of the psychology department who said that standardized testing would function as a dunce cap making people aware of their inferiority making them reluctance to compete and even even reproduce themselves There s a current to this not a strain but a powerful central current right before the first world war reaching a tremendous visible crescendo sometime right after the second world war after which it disintegrated itself rather than provoking controversy as a duty thing and not talk about it p p I stumbled upon all of this while I was trying to figure out why on earth so many people appeared to have a vested interest in trying to stop me from doing what they knew worked in a school setting But I talked to each one of them individually they d admit that that quot its stupid but I have to do it because quot and then they d refer to the next highest person on the administrative ladder Eventually when we got the state education dept and I was able to talk to the people there they began referring to politicians not all politicians but certain politicians And when I spoke to some of their administrative assistants a few were honest enough to refer me to corps great foundations think tanks which were running this particular politician although this was hardly said but I heard that What we have done then displace authority over the lives of children into so many different hands many of those quite invisible that to approach this with a problem solving set of mind is really to frustrate yourself to death We re dealing with a system that s working exactly the way its supposed to work There are ways around that you can sabotage it like I did for many years and that works sometimes locally or parochially until you re caught You can sidestep it by sending your kids to some private schools but most private schools function the same way except that they re more cosmetic You can home school your children I mean they re a variety of ways around it but they re not all tackling the problem p p JB I want to ask you you said that anytime you do something that is right you get blocked Could you give me one example of what you did that was right and was blocked p p JTG Oh sure I ll give you the actual example that triggered my resignation and the op ed editorial in the wall street journal My school system that I continued to succeed in in the sense that my kids were succeeding including the kids that weren t supposed to succeed continued to move me into worse and worse school settings Until finally I ended up at the school that produced of the quot Central Park jogger quot rapists including a number of other distinctions And here using the essentially the same methods but it took a lot longer and I was an older man but using essentially the same methods the kids began to lose their quot kid quot quality and began to become people and have a vested interest in developing their minds and spirits and characters as far as they could When I saw this heartening response my method is then to offer more and more challenges and at some point a challenge to a kid is navigating in the adult world of reality that they see around them dimly p p I had arranged with the president of I ll call it quot Bell Telephone quot in New York to have my kids taken through to visit a telephone station in keeping with things that I had been doing for years At the moment that some executive was dispatched to pick up the kids at the school and take them to the station our principal raced to the door that very moment confronted me and said quot these kids can t go out they haven t filed the proper papers quot I said quot sure I did Jules I dropped those in your box hours ago quot He said quot the policies have changed it has to be done two week in advance sent to the district and approved quot And I said quot ok Jules the next time quot and he said quot No quot In front of some vice president of the phone company with the kids all assembled together At that point I realized that what happened was not an independent decision by the principal but rather a frantic attempt by the school district which happens to be on the Upper West Side of Manhattan In fact they were disturbed by the continued success of children who happened to be under my direction The truth is they could have been under anyone s direction who had followed the same sort of system dirt farmers would have followed years ago p p JB Now what did you do for the kids with the kids that triggered this kind of retaliatory response p p JTG Essentially I operated on a couple of really simple assumptions That this bizarre and disturbing behavior that kids not only poor kids but really prosperous kids in New York were producing was a direct result of their lives being stripped of significant experiences confined in these abstract cells for all of their natural youth and set a diet of low level abstractions Not even the challenging debate material or text that you would have find in a fourth or fifth grade in the middle of the th century I mean that stuff that is reserved for the quot gifted quot or quot talented quot kids The ones in high school are doing sixth or seventh grade work by a century ago s standards p p JB If I can read between the lines you deviated from the standard curriculum that the administration wanted p p JTG I put together what I call a quot guerrilla quot curriculum Jerry and that was composed of stuffing them with primary experiences as much as I could from an ad hoc basis when I would read the paper in the morning or the night before Any kind of news going on I would have advance permission and the kids would be dispatched to investigate One part of this was I brought a kind of seminar standard to the classroom We didn t have to understand I ll use Aristotle as an example we didn t have to understand everything Aristotle was driving at to be absolutely certain that a lively discussion shows that much of what he was driving at were current topics in kids minds Once they got over the barrier of the language gap which is extremely easy to do just like teaching reading is extremely easy to do California s example to the world notwithstanding p p JB OK So you got them into more challenging material in a way which would change based on day to day events in the environment The way the administration saw it this was not in the structure that the curriculum was designed but you get that this was the way to give reality and aliveness to the learning experience p p JTG You re quite right but I think that the dynamic at work is worth exploring because its not as simple as the administration opposing it What s happening is that each subordinate level that has to give permission is on thin ice So that the ball is passed and when the ball leaves the local precincts it s really passed between foundation project officers certain university staff policy people in Washington so that in fact the ball never returns to your court or when it does its invariably ringed around with so many restrictions by other people who are making a living I m not alleging that its conscious but it happens To the point that you don t want to do it anymore p p JB We re taking a break we re talking with John Taylor Gatto John when we get back I want you to comment on the curve marking on the curve in standardized testing as a way to imbed the growing inequality in our society This is Jerry Brown don t go away p p commercial break p p JB Would you comment on the idea that grading on the curve which I presume most schools do is a way to put in a type of bell curve social stratification that is increasingly being replicated in almost every part of America p p JTG The idea very very early on it comes out of Prussian Germany in a series of debates in the th debates that arose out of Prussia that essentially said a mathematical or mathematized predictable world is the best out of all possible things to hope for The big people to read if you ve read Hegel himself I think you d know all you d need to know In order to control everybody certain strategic courses were undertaken in forced schooling There had never been prior to Prussia in the early th century been successful forced schooling in the history of the planet And suddenly Prussia in drew in all of the children put them in a stage system The first stage was to trivialize the greatest learning time by filling it I realize that this is going to get the backs up of some of your listeners with balloons songs and funny games But to keep the intellectual moral part under the control of the teacher Somewhere in the age of the idea was to set everyone suddenly in competition with each other and produce visible marks of rank everyone so that no matter how secure you were in your understanding of something there would always be people you could see who had been visibly recognized as your masters And according to Hegel and a number of other thinkers this constant quot alienation quot that was the world they used which was translated directly to American schools this alimentation would lead to the kind of society which could be placed under the direction of certified experts that the state and the corporate world found safe and productive The net result of this Jerry was that Prussia a dirt poor country in or years was one of the world leaders The Prussian king decided the Canadian American border because he was the most prestigious monarch on earth Hartsman and every other founder of American schooling before we had compulsory schooling went to Prussia and came back with glowing reports of what the Prussians had produced that is to say a predictable society that could be run by the best minds p p What you see on a normal bell curve probably at a moment when assessment is the wrong thing to do its inappropriate people learn on private learning curves We know the point in which we cross the barrier and understand something Some people learn instantly certain things and others learn six years later I will tell you this a kid who learns to read at five and a kid who learns to read at will be indistinguishable to each other at the age of fourteen assuming they both like what they re doing On the other hand we can say its too inconvenient or too expensive to allow that and impose a learning curve in first grade that produces this wonderful bell we can then assign the people on the fringes of the bell to special ed and the people in the middle of the bells the walls of the curve to the dull classes and so on And we will create a class system by simply doing that Inside of a year or two the kids will impose that kind of class system on themselves It s a phenomenally intricate but rather easy to unravel puzzle there reading is pathetically easy to teach you assume that once you assemble people in a room and do it in the same routines that you ll fail to teach it to some of them that this bell will appear and the atmosphere in the classroom is that the humiliation of being a dull reader or bad reader will never wear off You can predict the rise of a giant remediation industry p p On the other hand I want your to compare it to or when the founder of the DuPont fortune wrote to investors in France and said there s a miracle going on in this country because everyone here can read and debate like a lawyer quot There s nobody who can t read and they re facile with numbers quot Or you can look at De Tocqueville s famous analysis when he said that the classical Greeks are children compared to these dirt farmer s kids Look at the best sellers of that day The Last of the Mohicans by James Fennimore Cooper I would urge your readers to get an uncut version of Last of the Mohicans especially if they have one or two college degrees and see what an impossible book it is to read And yet it sold the equivalent of million copies p p JB I notice that you re also saying that judging from the Army Intelligence Test that you have of the whites who can t read and of the African Americans who can t read p p JTG Its just amazing because just in these figures were just for the white group and for the African American group p p JB Do you believe John do you believe those numbers because they re very shocking Ouml p p JTG I believe those numbers from my own experience When you try to reconstruct the intellect of a tear old kid which is essentially what my classroom was about you re dealing with social resistance which is quite unbelievable yet I just got a call today from a kid who had criminal charges against him at and furthermore he was filed as a functional illiterate by the school He s working on his second college degree and trying to decide among offers which would make him leave academia This is a boy that wanted to have a gun at he s only about now So what miracle happened Well the miracle that happened was that he was given himself back and it didn t take a N Y teacher of the year to do that I m not claiming any particular insight other than what was common knowledge a century ago This country was unique in world history because it took ordinary people people who were considered trash in Europe and made them independent hard working self respecting people To deny what is unique about American history is just nuts because in there we have the skeleton key to unlock the problem of our schools p p JB My own grandmother I think went to school until the th grade she was quite a reader well into her s very well read Now we have a world in which this president is saying that we have to create a situation that everyone can have at least two years of college in the same way that I suppose that the th grade was assumed to be necessary at the beginning of the century p p JTG I hope that he s just a dupe Jerry I really hope so The way that the game works is that we say that the reason this problem exists is that A we don t have enough money and B we don t have enough of the kids lives to work on them So we ve watched schooling go from an average weeks and produce a totally literate nation p p JB weeks or years p p JTG weeks The truth is that nowhere in the US as late as nowhere did more than of the people go to school p p JB And when they went to school you re saying that they only went for weeks That s only a couple of months p p JTG And kids who went for longer than that didn t go every day or even every week So they came and went And furthermore they were under the control of one woman who had ages and class sizes of that s an impossible situation according to the way we do business today And yet as soon as you change the teacher student ratio from the teacher being of the solution and the student to the reverse of that the student of the solution the teacher then you can see how very large classes or mixed classes can work because the kids are responsible teaching each other p p JB What I m hearing here one of the key building blocks more important than TV in the development of a society of dependent obedient sheep like herdlike uncritical people is that the school is the mechanism of schooling enshrined as a secular religion So if the goal is independent thinking self reliance critical thinking all the good stuff that Abe Lincoln Benjamin Franklin held up as such important values then somehow this whole schooling mechanism needs to be smashed And I want to get that very clear because there is a childlike devotion to the school system that reminds me of the quot Devotion of the Blessed Mother quot at St Brendan s grammar school years ago p p JTG It was sold that way all of this the various media sold it this way I m not saying that there was a cabal but simply that it was the way it was presented to them Flattering luncheons where the decision has been made to take that wonderful woman who had run without an administration those one room schools which had done so well and put her under the direction of an apparatus of men not just a single layer but infinite layers which are still being spun out p p JB It almost sounds like the apparatchiks in the late stage Soviet Union p p JTG That s an excellent kernel The question is whether this grows naturally as a result of certain economic decision MIT makes mandatory I believe a book called quot Autonomous Technology quot by Langdon Winter written about years ago in which Winters says once you start with certain premises it is inevitable that the system will eventually control all the personnel the apparent leaders will remain only as long as they serve the system s purposes if they don t heir marginalized and gotten rid of and someone else is put in p p A lot of them that the family was the barrier to a sane future They may not have liked each other but they all agreed that you had to get children away from the family School was the mechanism to utopianize I think both things are at work here ideologues who communicate this idea and are able to perpetuate themselves from generation to generation They control hiring at universities and foundations and so on and look for people like themselves p p JB Today we get a report of Al Shanker s funeral a memorial Al Shanker being the head of the United Federation of Teachers of America probably the most powerful educator of this country And you have Senator Kennedy representing the Left wing of the remnant Democratic Party and you have former New York City mayor Ed Koch once a Democrat but now a populist corporatist conservative former New York mayor So you have a pretty wide spectrum at least on the left right spectrum giving real encomiums of adulation to the creative work of Shanker which as far as I know without speaking ill of the deceased Shanker was a pillar of this entire apparatus which you have been criticizing for the last minutes p p JTG He was Let me say not in Shanker s defense but an explanation of how Shanker managed to draw support from all portions of the political spectrum Shanker was to his credit very outspoken of the division that he represented Shanker is as close to being a classical old line socialist nor did he make any bones about that Shanker is on record a number of times saying that schools are not about the best destiny for the children schools are not about making Johnny s family stronger or bringing his parents in on the governance or deliberations I had dinner twice with Shanker I was at this small table with him and I must say that compared to everyone else at the table probably me included that Shanker absolutely said what was on his mind laughs Not that I agreed with him p p JB But that s the real issue what is on his mind and what s on America s mind is that the problem of America is that there is not enough education there s not enough getting to these poor people who are causing all of the crime or there s not enough in the middle to compete with the Japanese or the Chinese or all of those smart people And the answer is whether it s the market based people who have their strategy or the liberals who have theirs one way or another its to get these little kids more programs for the competitive world and not for the kind of disruptive individual critical thinking which I believe you re suggesting and that I certainly very much recommend p p break p p JB John I m going to read you something that you ve said and I m going to ask you how to attain what you re suggesting I quote quot We have to radically decentralize government corporate schooling return the power of designing and assessing programs to the local level and ensure that every form of training for the young aims at producing independent self reliant minds good characters and individuals who get fighting mad when called a quot human resource quot and told their main function is to be part of the work force Ok great I accept that so how do we get there Who do we attack and what do we build p p JTG The schema first has to be seen clearly as long as the economy is built up of very large corporations very large institutions and very large government agencies by necessity all the training that is approved leads towards some position on the pecking order of these giant employment pyramids I d like to jump from that to two groups who have never participated in that and who ve had a sort of blemished record of success I d like to do this to allow your listeners to independently verify that its possible p p Look at Johns Hopkins University not one of my favorite universities but they ve been tracking the Amish for a long time They ve published several I think mind blowing books about what has happened in Amish America In this century at the beginning of the century there were of these people now there are So the group itself has retained its integrity and grown times Second of the Amish or as close to that as humanly possible has independent livelihoods and its divided in small entrepreneurial businesses and in small farms Now consider the drawbacks these people labor under the government of Pennsylvania has been their sworn enemy through the century And they don t use telephones they don t use computers they don t use cars and they go to the sup th sup grade only because the Supreme Court cut a deal with them in the So with all these drawbacks you have a community that with all intents and purposes has no crime at all that takes care of old and young because it mixes both of those groups together in the life of the community is amazingly successful amazingly wealthy and amazingly unschooled Now many of your listeners or my friends who would no doubt say that it s that religious glue that pious glue that gives them the advantage So I d like to jump to the group that s resolutely militantly free thought probably as any that s ever existed p p And that s in the Basque country in Spain the north west of Spain and its forgive my accent the Mondragon Cooperative There s about the same number of these people as there are Amish and they aim for exactly the same grown up solution that everyone will have an independent livelihood or they ll be a part of a small group that makes its living proving to other people that it s valuable So their schooling is resolutely directed toward developing the kind of independent self reliant tough minded characteristics that oddly enough Amish education also stresses p p So here we have bracketed now two groups that are small but not that small who manage to keep what Lincoln s idea for America was Independent livelihood was where it was at You know back in the s s it was impossible to assemble an American work force over because people would only work for you long enough to get a little stake and then cut off and go off on their own When we look at the history of New England factories that they re going to concerts and dances and libraries for the young girls who worked there for just a couple of years until they could bring a little stake to their marriage That was the American dream that you could write the script to your own life And very very gradually that dream was converted and this is quite easy to track not by evil people but by people who understood that wealth depends on your ability to command labor And unless you can assemble large groups of labor you were never going to be wealthy as the Europeans reckoned wealth or the English reckoned wealth p p JB Ok John since we have a few callers on the line I d like to encapsulate what you re saying that the accumulation of great wealth requires the ability to command labor You cannot labor if its independent and critical therefore you need a schooling system much in the way that obedience school provides for dogs they have to be taught not to pee in the house or heel at their master s beck and call And in effect the entire school enterprise and there are obvious examples is a huge obedience school run on the kennel model And the two examples you ve given me Amish which is based on a character traditional very family based with a very god centered decentralized form and the other one which you refer to as secular is the worker owned cooperatives in the Basque land in Spain Two poles which are totally at variance with the consumer mass obedience operation which is cheerleaded from Jesse Jackson on the Left or Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan even more to the Left to you know the Right Wing folks the Moral Majority and the chamber of commerce p p So if I hear you right what we really have to face up to is the absolute need for a critical distancing from this whole status quo which seeps into our deepest aims p p JTG Absolutely that s a perfect abstract Notice that we can eliminate Marxist ideas that evil or venal people are doing this What is happened is that the people who are doing this have convinced themselves quot scientifically quot that this is the only that it can be This is what sociologist Thomas Malthus biologist Charles Darwin or chemist John Dalton all said This is what the book the Bell Curve a couple of years ago said This is the way wishes it to be it can t be any other way So they have to overlook Jaime Escalante in California or Marva Collins in Chicago or even John Taylor Gatto in New York They have to overlook the Basques they have to overlook the Amish because they don t fit that theory p p JB So John then I take it you have no objection to vouchers p p JTG Its not that I have no objection to vouchers there s a real danger built into vouchers and that is the same sort of surveillance over your kids lives will follow the voucher What we have to do and we re going to do it whether its allowed or now we have to begin to break the fealty to these enormous organizations whether they re government or corporate or institutions p p JB Ok let s take a few calls now Craig has been waiting go ahead Craig p p Craig Thank you for your recent programs with Susannah Shepherd and Grace Malone We are a home schooling family for many years and I guess in a sense I d like to explain why it is we home school I d like to start by recommending a book quot Teaching as a Subversive Activity quot by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner And I d would say that anyone who has an interest in this subject if you have not read that book consider yourself uneducated That book was written in didn t deal with home schooling but it does explains the need to raise children who do not just accept the unexamined assumptions of our society That impulse is out there across the country but its really at war against what seems to be a stronger approach to suppress that kind of approach I know there are exceptions there are good teachers who really want to educate kids in the truest sense of the term but they re fighting the system What I really want to say here is that the school system at its heart even though yes its their to in some sense to educate the children but at its heart its really there to break their spirits That is what I think all the time We ve had some experience with our own children for short periods of time at our local schools and its only confirmed and reinforced what we already thought we knew p p JB Thank you Craig very eloquent John p p JTG I d like to comment on what Craig said on breaking the spirit The most influential US commissioner of education that ever existed was William Torre Harris and in a book he wrote back in The Philosophy of Education he said that the purpose of schooling was to alienate children from their families their churches their neighborhoods and themselves I mean it wasn t a secret its just that people who walk their dogs or look at the sun come up in the morning they don t have time to read books called quot The Philosophy of Education quot laughs Of course that s what it s about p p JB Amazing p p JTG He was the only prominent school man who and I believe that s still true who was a house guest to the Rockefellers the Carnegies Harris brought German schooling to the US and made sure that it stuck p p JB All right let s take a call from Angel in New Jersey p p Angel Hi thank you both My question concerns what I seem to see as an apparent contradiction between the acknowledged purpose of the school systems as they now stand and the stated belief that they can in fact be altered without actually altering the primary purposes of society In other words with corporations wanting a docile work force with a government needing a military going overseas and to engage in practices that many would consider are against the very interests of the very people who are being asked to fight in that military why would you believe that under the current system that people who are in control of the schools ultimately the politicians would in fact want to change the system so that it would in fact produce critical thinkers p p JB Ok angel you ve just asked the question I think you re hitting it right on the head here you re going to need to change a lot more than just the schoolhouse p p JTG Angel let me speak to that One of the great ways that people are held in place by their own fear Because these enormous employment pyramids control the flow of money and even the flow of information around the whole country you might assume that nothing can be done about them The truth is they have almost no internal cohesion at all they hate each other Look how fast the soviet union came apart I would like to just tell you very quickly here that I sat with Jeane Kirkpatrick about two weeks before the first signs of the crack took place There were a few other people in the room and she said in that cold steely flinty voice of hers quot let me tell you that it won t be for a hundred years that you see a crack in the soviet union because they have a personal dossier of every citizen and they have mathematical ways of telling where the fault lines will appear quot And two weeks later of course it was dying and a short time after that it was dead p p JB Ok John John we ve got to break in One hour has gone by We ll do it again we ll do it again but we are out of time We ll come back to this topic again there s a lot more to dig in and there s a lot of people who want to talk about the public schools This is Jerry Brown for We the People thanks for

href archivestyle css head body h John Taylor Gatto br New York State Teacher of the Year Interview By Jerry Brown h h March h br p Jerry Brown Welcome to another edition of We The People this hour we re going to talk some more about learning education and schooling in its many variations To help us reflect more deeply on this question we have on a line from New York John Taylor Gatto he was named the New York Teacher of the Year in he was also named New York City Teacher of the Year in as well as He resigned from teaching during his state titled year and he s put out an op ed piece in the Wall St Journal and four months later he was honored by his former students in a program at Carnegie Hall called quot An Evening With John Taylor Gatto the Exhausted School quot He s written the book quot Dumbing Down the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schools quot p p So what should I call you not professor of course just John John welcome to the show Call me Jerry p p John Taylor Gatto Okay Governor I ll you Jerry p p Jerry Brown Ok It s a real pleasure I ve been reading some of your material and its certainly harkens back to a couple of major influences on my teaching or rather my school ideas one Ivan Illich and the other Paul Goodman I guess I got off the trail there in and I read the book quot Compulsory Mis education quot and I ve never quite been able to get the hang of school issues since p p John Taylor Gatto I know both of those writers and they ve had a big influence on me as well p p JB Well tell me John you ve been in the school business thirty odd years teaching in the public schools of New York so can you state here in the beginning what the problem is here with here People are just wringing their hands and it doesn t seem like anything is going to get better with the path that we re on p p JTG Well there s a lot of problems Jerry But I think they boil down to a quick slug of we don t teach the way children learn and because the business has become really a central part of the American economy you re really not allowed to teach the way children learn although any individual component in this system would admit privately that they wish they d allow you to do that You have the perfect example of that out your way an elderly Peruvian immigrant in a school near Los Angeles inside of four years had the best scores on the Advanced Placement Calculus Test I m sure he was an excellent teacher but that s really beside the point He was working with a group of kids with no mathematical tradition and very little literary tradition and inside of a short time Garfield High was the third ranking school in the US on the AP calculus Mr Escalante s fate is just fascinating he was harassed and hounded out the school They made it intolerable for him to stay p p In Chicago there s a black lady named Marva Collins working with black ghetto kids many of them with no intact families She found out what I found later on which was that these children have no resistance to very high level work and ideation In a quick take if you set the idiom aside they re producing work of a caliber that we associate with adults I know this must sound fantastic to your listeners but the truth is you and I could spend hours and not come to the end of people who ve accidentally stumbled on the great dirty secret of American schooling it just doesn t teach the way children learn nor can it be allowed to or maybe that s just momentum and not design We re dealing with a billion dollar a year industry it s the gatekeeper to all of the rest of the jobs We couldn t turn out an excess of competent people without really doing damage to this economy If this sounds like I m playing a conspiratorial string on my violin hardly the president of Columbia s teacher s college Dean Russell in in the keynote speech to the NEA said that there was a tremendous danger that too many leader s would be produced and it would cause a collapse in the system p p JB I m reading where a quote that you have in an article by you by Edward Roth in his book written in called quot Social Control quot says the following quot plans are on the way to replace community family and church with propaganda education and mass media People are only little plastic lumps of human dough quot Now you quote that I suppose because for you it encapsulates the underlying spirit of education in America p p JTG Yeah I actually used that in a book that s coming out in the summer called quot the Empty Child quot by Simon and Schuster Since they wouldn t give me the million words I needed I needed to find the most trenchant reflection of this attitude towards children that they re little plastic lumps of dough Roth of course is not just a professor of sociology he was one of the two or three people who created the American discipline of sociology And you also have a few years later Geddard of Princeton the head of the psychology department who said that standardized testing would function as a dunce cap making people aware of their inferiority making them reluctance to compete and even even reproduce themselves There s a current to this not a strain but a powerful central current right before the first world war reaching a tremendous visible crescendo sometime right after the second world war after which it disintegrated itself rather than provoking controversy as a duty thing and not talk about it p p I stumbled upon all of this while I was trying to figure out why on earth so many people appeared to have a vested interest in trying to stop me from doing what they knew worked in a school setting But I talked to each one of them individually they d admit that that quot its stupid but I have to do it because quot and then they d refer to the next highest person on the administrative ladder Eventually when we got the state education dept and I was able to talk to the people there they began referring to politicians not all politicians but certain politicians And when I spoke to some of their administrative assistants a few were honest enough to refer me to corps great foundations think tanks which were running this particular politician although this was hardly said but I heard that What we have done then displace authority over the lives of children into so many different hands many of those quite invisible that to approach this with a problem solving set of mind is really to frustrate yourself to death We re dealing with a system that s working exactly the way its supposed to work There are ways around that you can sabotage it like I did for many years and that works sometimes locally or parochially until you re caught You can sidestep it by sending your kids to some private schools but most private schools function the same way except that they re more cosmetic You can home school your children I mean they re a variety of ways around it but they re not all tackling the problem p p JB I want to ask you you said that anytime you do something that is right you get blocked Could you give me one example of what you did that was right and was blocked p p JTG Oh sure I ll give you the actual example that triggered my resignation and the op ed editorial in the wall street journal My school system that I continued to succeed in in the sense that my kids were succeeding including the kids that weren t supposed to succeed continued to move me into worse and worse school settings Until finally I ended up at the school that produced of the quot Central Park jogger quot rapists including a number of other distinctions And here using the essentially the same methods but it took a lot longer and I was an older man but using essentially the same methods the kids began to lose their quot kid quot quality and began to become people and have a vested interest in developing their minds and spirits and characters as far as they could When I saw this heartening response my method is then to offer more and more challenges and at some point a challenge to a kid is navigating in the adult world of reality that they see around them dimly p p I had arranged with the president of I ll call it quot Bell Telephone quot in New York to have my kids taken through to visit a telephone station in keeping with things that I had been doing for years At the moment that some executive was dispatched to pick up the kids at the school and take them to the station our principal raced to the door that very moment confronted me and said quot these kids can t go out they haven t filed the proper papers quot I said quot sure I did Jules I dropped those in your box hours ago quot He said quot the policies have changed it has to be done two week in advance sent to the district and approved quot And I said quot ok Jules the next time quot and he said quot No quot In front of some vice president of the phone company with the kids all assembled together At that point I realized that what happened was not an independent decision by the principal but rather a frantic attempt by the school district which happens to be on the Upper West Side of Manhattan In fact they were disturbed by the continued success of children who happened to be under my direction The truth is they could have been under anyone s direction who had followed the same sort of system dirt farmers would have followed years ago p p JB Now what did you do for the kids with the kids that triggered this kind of retaliatory response p p JTG Essentially I operated on a couple of really simple assumptions That this bizarre and disturbing behavior that kids not only poor kids but really prosperous kids in New York were producing was a direct result of their lives being stripped of significant experiences confined in these abstract cells for all of their natural youth and set a diet of low level abstractions Not even the challenging debate material or text that you would have find in a fourth or fifth grade in the middle of the th century I mean that stuff that is reserved for the quot gifted quot or quot talented quot kids The ones in high school are doing sixth or seventh grade work by a century ago s standards p p JB If I can read between the lines you deviated from the standard curriculum that the administration wanted p p JTG I put together what I call a quot guerrilla quot curriculum Jerry and that was composed of stuffing them with primary experiences as much as I could from an ad hoc basis when I would read the paper in the morning or the night before Any kind of news going on I would have advance permission and the kids would be dispatched to investigate One part of this was I brought a kind of seminar standard to the classroom We didn t have to understand I ll use Aristotle as an example we didn t have to understand everything Aristotle was driving at to be absolutely certain that a lively discussion shows that much of what he was driving at were current topics in kids minds Once they got over the barrier of the language gap which is extremely easy to do just like teaching reading is extremely easy to do California s example to the world notwithstanding p p JB OK So you got them into more challenging material in a way which would change based on day to day events in the environment The way the administration saw it this was not in the structure that the curriculum was designed but you get that this was the way to give reality and aliveness to the learning experience p p JTG You re quite right but I think that the dynamic at work is worth exploring because its not as simple as the administration opposing it What s happening is that each subordinate level that has to give permission is on thin ice So that the ball is passed and when the ball leaves the local precincts it s really passed between foundation project officers certain university staff policy people in Washington so that in fact the ball never returns to your court or when it does its invariably ringed around with so many restrictions by other people who are making a living I m not alleging that its conscious but it happens To the point that you don t want to do it anymore p p JB We re taking a break we re talking with John Taylor Gatto John when we get back I want you to comment on the curve marking on the curve in standardized testing as a way to imbed the growing inequality in our society This is Jerry Brown don t go away p p commercial break p p JB Would you comment on the idea that grading on the curve which I presume most schools do is a way to put in a type of bell curve social stratification that is increasingly being replicated in almost every part of America p p JTG The idea very very early on it comes out of Prussian Germany in a series of debates in the th debates that arose out of Prussia that essentially said a mathematical or mathematized predictable world is the best out of all possible things to hope for The big people to read if you ve read Hegel himself I think you d know all you d need to know In order to control everybody certain strategic courses were undertaken in forced schooling There had never been prior to Prussia in the early th century been successful forced schooling in the history of the planet And suddenly Prussia in drew in all of the children put them in a stage system The first stage was to trivialize the greatest learning time by filling it I realize that this is going to get the backs up of some of your listeners with balloons songs and funny games But to keep the intellectual moral part under the control of the teacher Somewhere in the age of the idea was to set everyone suddenly in competition with each other and produce visible marks of rank everyone so that no matter how secure you were in your understanding of something there would always be people you could see who had been visibly recognized as your masters And according to Hegel and a number of other thinkers this constant quot alienation quot that was the world they used which was translated directly to American schools this alimentation would lead to the kind of society which could be placed under the direction of certified experts that the state and the corporate world found safe and productive The net result of this Jerry was that Prussia a dirt poor country in or years was one of the world leaders The Prussian king decided the Canadian American border because he was the most prestigious monarch on earth Hartsman and every other founder of American schooling before we had compulsory schooling went to Prussia and came back with glowing reports of what the Prussians had produced that is to say a predictable society that could be run by the best minds p p What you see on a normal bell curve probably at a moment when assessment is the wrong thing to do its inappropriate people learn on private learning curves We know the point in which we cross the barrier and understand something Some people learn instantly certain things and others learn six years later I will tell you this a kid who learns to read at five and a kid who learns to read at will be indistinguishable to each other at the age of fourteen assuming they both like what they re doing On the other hand we can say its too inconvenient or too expensive to allow that and impose a learning curve in first grade that produces this wonderful bell we can then assign the people on the fringes of the bell to special ed and the people in the middle of the bells the walls of the curve to the dull classes and so on And we will create a class system by simply doing that Inside of a year or two the kids will impose that kind of class system on themselves It s a phenomenally intricate but rather easy to unravel puzzle there reading is pathetically easy to teach you assume that once you assemble people in a room and do it in the same routines that you ll fail to teach it to some of them that this bell will appear and the atmosphere in the classroom is that the humiliation of being a dull reader or bad reader will never wear off You can predict the rise of a giant remediation industry p p On the other hand I want your to compare it to or when the founder of the DuPont fortune wrote to investors in France and said there s a miracle going on in this country because everyone here can read and debate like a lawyer quot There s nobody who can t read and they re facile with numbers quot Or you can look at De Tocqueville s famous analysis when he said that the classical Greeks are children compared to these dirt farmer s kids Look at the best sellers of that day The Last of the Mohicans by James Fennimore Cooper I would urge your readers to get an uncut version of Last of the Mohicans especially if they have one or two college degrees and see what an impossible book it is to read And yet it sold the equivalent of million copies p p JB I notice that you re also saying that judging from the Army Intelligence Test that you have of the whites who can t read and of the African Americans who can t read p p JTG Its just amazing because just in these figures were just for the white group and for the African American group p p JB Do you believe John do you believe those numbers because they re very shocking Ouml p p JTG I believe those numbers from my own experience When you try to reconstruct the intellect of a tear old kid which is essentially what my classroom was about you re dealing with social resistance which is quite unbelievable yet I just got a call today from a kid who had criminal charges against him at and furthermore he was filed as a functional illiterate by the school He s working on his second college degree and trying to decide among offers which would make him leave academia This is a boy that wanted to have a gun at he s only about now So what miracle happened Well the miracle that happened was that he was given himself back and it didn t take a N Y teacher of the year to do that I m not claiming any particular insight other than what was common knowledge a century ago This country was unique in world history because it took ordinary people people who were considered trash in Europe and made them independent hard working self respecting people To deny what is unique about American history is just nuts because in there we have the skeleton key to unlock the problem of our schools p p JB My own grandmother I think went to school until the th grade she was quite a reader well into her s very well read Now we have a world in which this president is saying that we have to create a situation that everyone can have at least two years of college in the same way that I suppose that the th grade was assumed to be necessary at the beginning of the century p p JTG I hope that he s just a dupe Jerry I really hope so The way that the game works is that we say that the reason this problem exists is that A we don t have enough money and B we don t have enough of the kids lives to work on them So we ve watched schooling go from an average weeks and produce a totally literate nation p p JB weeks or years p p JTG weeks The truth is that nowhere in the US as late as nowhere did more than of the people go to school p p JB And when they went to school you re saying that they only went for weeks That s only a couple of months p p JTG And kids who went for longer than that didn t go every day or even every week So they came and went And furthermore they were under the control of one woman who had ages and class sizes of that s an impossible situation according to the way we do business today And yet as soon as you change the teacher student ratio from the teacher being of the solution and the student to the reverse of that the student of the solution the teacher then you can see how very large classes or mixed classes can work because the kids are responsible teaching each other p p JB What I m hearing here one of the key building blocks more important than TV in the development of a society of dependent obedient sheep like herdlike uncritical people is that the school is the mechanism of schooling enshrined as a secular religion So if the goal is independent thinking self reliance critical thinking all the good stuff that Abe Lincoln Benjamin Franklin held up as such important values then somehow this whole schooling mechanism needs to be smashed And I want to get that very clear because there is a childlike devotion to the school system that reminds me of the quot Devotion of the Blessed Mother quot at St Brendan s grammar school years ago p p JTG It was sold that way all of this the various media sold it this way I m not saying that there was a cabal but simply that it was the way it was presented to them Flattering luncheons where the decision has been made to take that wonderful woman who had run without an administration those one room schools which had done so well and put her under the direction of an apparatus of men not just a single layer but infinite layers which are still being spun out p p JB It almost sounds like the apparatchiks in the late stage Soviet Union p p JTG That s an excellent kernel The question is whether this grows naturally as a result of certain economic decision MIT makes mandatory I believe a book called quot Autonomous Technology quot by Langdon Winter written about years ago in which Winters says once you start with certain premises it is inevitable that the system will eventually control all the personnel the apparent leaders will remain only as long as they serve the system s purposes if they don t heir marginalized and gotten rid of and someone else is put in p p A lot of them that the family was the barrier to a sane future They may not have liked each other but they all agreed that you had to get children away from the family School was the mechanism to utopianize I think both things are at work here ideologues who communicate this idea and are able to perpetuate themselves from generation to generation They control hiring at universities and foundations and so on and look for people like themselves p p JB Today we get a report of Al Shanker s funeral a memorial Al Shanker being the head of the United Federation of Teachers of America probably the most powerful educator of this country And you have Senator Kennedy representing the Left wing of the remnant Democratic Party and you have former New York City mayor Ed Koch once a Democrat but now a populist corporatist conservative former New York mayor So you have a pretty wide spectrum at least on the left right spectrum giving real encomiums of adulation to the creative work of Shanker which as far as I know without speaking ill of the deceased Shanker was a pillar of this entire apparatus which you have been criticizing for the last minutes p p JTG He was Let me say not in Shanker s defense but an explanation of how Shanker managed to draw support from all portions of the political spectrum Shanker was to his credit very outspoken of the division that he represented Shanker is as close to being a classical old line socialist nor did he make any bones about that Shanker is on record a number of times saying that schools are not about the best destiny for the children schools are not about making Johnny s family stronger or bringing his parents in on the governance or deliberations I had dinner twice with Shanker I was at this small table with him and I must say that compared to everyone else at the table probably me included that Shanker absolutely said what was on his mind laughs Not that I agreed with him p p JB But that s the real issue what is on his mind and what s on America s mind is that the problem of America is that there is not enough education there s not enough getting to these poor people who are causing all of the crime or there s not enough in the middle to compete with the Japanese or the Chinese or all of those smart people And the answer is whether it s the market based people who have their strategy or the liberals who have theirs one way or another its to get these little kids more programs for the competitive world and not for the kind of disruptive individual critical thinking which I believe you re suggesting and that I certainly very much recommend p p break p p JB John I m going to read you something that you ve said and I m going to ask you how to attain what you re suggesting I quote quot We have to radically decentralize government corporate schooling return the power of designing and assessing programs to the local level and ensure that every form of training for the young aims at producing independent self reliant minds good characters and individuals who get fighting mad when called a quot human resource quot and told their main function is to be part of the work force Ok great I accept that so how do we get there Who do we attack and what do we build p p JTG The schema first has to be seen clearly as long as the economy is built up of very large corporations very large institutions and very large government agencies by necessity all the training that is approved leads towards some position on the pecking order of these giant employment pyramids I d like to jump from that to two groups who have never participated in that and who ve had a sort of blemished record of success I d like to do this to allow your listeners to independently verify that its possible p p Look at Johns Hopkins University not one of my favorite universities but they ve been tracking the Amish for a long time They ve published several I think mind blowing books about what has happened in Amish America In this century at the beginning of the century there were of these people now there are So the group itself has retained its integrity and grown times Second of the Amish or as close to that as humanly possible has independent livelihoods and its divided in small entrepreneurial businesses and in small farms Now consider the drawbacks these people labor under the government of Pennsylvania has been their sworn enemy through the century And they don t use telephones they don t use computers they don t use cars and they go to the sup th sup grade only because the Supreme Court cut a deal with them in the So with all these drawbacks you have a community that with all intents and purposes has no crime at all that takes care of old and young because it mixes both of those groups together in the life of the community is amazingly successful amazingly wealthy and amazingly unschooled Now many of your listeners or my friends who would no doubt say that it s that religious glue that pious glue that gives them the advantage So I d like to jump to the group that s resolutely militantly free thought probably as any that s ever existed p p And that s in the Basque country in Spain the north west of Spain and its forgive my accent the Mondragon Cooperative There s about the same number of these people as there are Amish and they aim for exactly the same grown up solution that everyone will have an independent livelihood or they ll be a part of a small group that makes its living proving to other people that it s valuable So their schooling is resolutely directed toward developing the kind of independent self reliant tough minded characteristics that oddly enough Amish education also stresses p p So here we have bracketed now two groups that are small but not that small who manage to keep what Lincoln s idea for America was Independent livelihood was where it was at You know back in the s s it was impossible to assemble an American work force over because people would only work for you long enough to get a little stake and then cut off and go off on their own When we look at the history of New England factories that they re going to concerts and dances and libraries for the young girls who worked there for just a couple of years until they could bring a little stake to their marriage That was the American dream that you could write the script to your own life And very very gradually that dream was converted and this is quite easy to track not by evil people but by people who understood that wealth depends on your ability to command labor And unless you can assemble large groups of labor you were never going to be wealthy as the Europeans reckoned wealth or the English reckoned wealth p p JB Ok John since we have a few callers on the line I d like to encapsulate what you re saying that the accumulation of great wealth requires the ability to command labor You cannot labor if its independent and critical therefore you need a schooling system much in the way that obedience school provides for dogs they have to be taught not to pee in the house or heel at their master s beck and call And in effect the entire school enterprise and there are obvious examples is a huge obedience school run on the kennel model And the two examples you ve given me Amish which is based on a character traditional very family based with a very god centered decentralized form and the other one which you refer to as secular is the worker owned cooperatives in the Basque land in Spain Two poles which are totally at variance with the consumer mass obedience operation which is cheerleaded from Jesse Jackson on the Left or Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan even more to the Left to you know the Right Wing folks the Moral Majority and the chamber of commerce p p So if I hear you right what we really have to face up to is the absolute need for a critical distancing from this whole status quo which seeps into our deepest aims p p JTG Absolutely that s a perfect abstract Notice that we can eliminate Marxist ideas that evil or venal people are doing this What is happened is that the people who are doing this have convinced themselves quot scientifically quot that this is the only that it can be This is what sociologist Thomas Malthus biologist Charles Darwin or chemist John Dalton all said This is what the book the Bell Curve a couple of years ago said This is the way wishes it to be it can t be any other way So they have to overlook Jaime Escalante in California or Marva Collins in Chicago or even John Taylor Gatto in New York They have to overlook the Basques they have to overlook the Amish because they don t fit that theory p p JB So John then I take it you have no objection to vouchers p p JTG Its not that I have no objection to vouchers there s a real danger built into vouchers and that is the same sort of surveillance over your kids lives will follow the voucher What we have to do and we re going to do it whether its allowed or now we have to begin to break the fealty to these enormous organizations whether they re government or corporate or institutions p p JB Ok let s take a few calls now Craig has been waiting go ahead Craig p p Craig Thank you for your recent programs with Susannah Shepherd and Grace Malone We are a home schooling family for many years and I guess in a sense I d like to explain why it is we home school I d like to start by recommending a book quot Teaching as a Subversive Activity quot by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner And I d would say that anyone who has an interest in this subject if you have not read that book consider yourself uneducated That book was written in didn t deal with home schooling but it does explains the need to raise children who do not just accept the unexamined assumptions of our society That impulse is out there across the country but its really at war against what seems to be a stronger approach to suppress that kind of approach I know there are exceptions there are good teachers who really want to educate kids in the truest sense of the term but they re fighting the system What I really want to say here is that the school system at its heart even though yes its their to in some sense to educate the children but at its heart its really there to break their spirits That is what I think all the time We ve had some experience with our own children for short periods of time at our local schools and its only confirmed and reinforced what we already thought we knew p p JB Thank you Craig very eloquent John p p JTG I d like to comment on what Craig said on breaking the spirit The most influential US commissioner of education that ever existed was William Torre Harris and in a book he wrote back in The Philosophy of Education he said that the purpose of schooling was to alienate children from their families their churches their neighborhoods and themselves I mean it wasn t a secret its just that people who walk their dogs or look at the sun come up in the morning they don t have time to read books called quot The Philosophy of Education quot laughs Of course that s what it s about p p JB Amazing p p JTG He was the only prominent school man who and I believe that s still true who was a house guest to the Rockefellers the Carnegies Harris brought German schooling to the US and made sure that it stuck p p JB All right let s take a call from Angel in New Jersey p p Angel Hi thank you both My question concerns what I seem to see as an apparent contradiction between the acknowledged purpose of the school systems as they now stand and the stated belief that they can in fact be altered without actually altering the primary purposes of society In other words with corporations wanting a docile work force with a government needing a military going overseas and to engage in practices that many would consider are against the very interests of the very people who are being asked to fight in that military why would you believe that under the current system that people who are in control of the schools ultimately the politicians would in fact want to change the system so that it would in fact produce critical thinkers p p JB Ok angel you ve just asked the question I think you re hitting it right on the head here you re going to need to change a lot more than just the schoolhouse p p JTG Angel let me speak to that One of the great ways that people are held in place by their own fear Because these enormous employment pyramids control the flow of money and even the flow of information around the whole country you might assume that nothing can be done about them The truth is they have almost no internal cohesion at all they hate each other Look how fast the soviet union came apart I would like to just tell you very quickly here that I sat with Jeane Kirkpatrick about two weeks before the first signs of the crack took place There were a few other people in the room and she said in that cold steely flinty voice of hers quot let me tell you that it won t be for a hundred years that you see a crack in the soviet union because they have a personal dossier of every citizen and they have mathematical ways of telling where the fault lines will appear quot And two weeks later of course it was dying and a short time after that it was dead p p JB Ok John John we ve got to break in One hour has gone by We ll do it again we ll do it again but we are out of time We ll come back to this topic again there s a lot more to dig in and there s a lot of people who want to talk about the public schools This is Jerry Brown for We the People thanks for

href archivestyle css head body h John Taylor Gatto br New York State Teacher of the Year Interview By Jerry Brown h h March h br p Jerry Brown Welcome to another edition of We The People this hour we re going to talk some more about learning education and schooling in its many variations To help us reflect more deeply on this question we have on a line from New York John Taylor Gatto he was named the New York Teacher of the Year in he was also named New York City Teacher of the Year in as well as He resigned from teaching during his state titled year and he s put out an op ed piece in the Wall St Journal and four months later he was honored by his former students in a program at Carnegie Hall called quot An Evening With John Taylor Gatto the Exhausted School quot He s written the book quot Dumbing Down the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schools quot p p So what should I call you not professor of course just John John welcome to the show Call me Jerry p p John Taylor Gatto Okay Governor I ll you Jerry p p Jerry Brown Ok It s a real pleasure I ve been reading some of your material and its certainly harkens back to a couple of major influences on my teaching or rather my school ideas one Ivan Illich and the other Paul Goodman I guess I got off the trail there in and I read the book quot Compulsory Mis education quot and I ve never quite been able to get the hang of school issues since p p John Taylor Gatto I know both of those writers and they ve had a big influence on me as well p p JB Well tell me John you ve been in the school business thirty odd years teaching in the public schools of New York so can you state here in the beginning what the problem is here with here People are just wringing their hands and it doesn t seem like anything is going to get better with the path that we re on p p JTG Well there s a lot of problems Jerry But I think they boil down to a quick slug of we don t teach the way children learn and because the business has become really a central part of the American economy you re really not allowed to teach the way children learn although any individual component in this system would admit privately that they wish they d allow you to do that You have the perfect example of that out your way an elderly Peruvian immigrant in a school near Los Angeles inside of four years had the best scores on the Advanced Placement Calculus Test I m sure he was an excellent teacher but that s really beside the point He was working with a group of kids with no mathematical tradition and very little literary tradition and inside of a short time Garfield High was the third ranking school in the US on the AP calculus Mr Escalante s fate is just fascinating he was harassed and hounded out the school They made it intolerable for him to stay p p In Chicago there s a black lady named Marva Collins working with black ghetto kids many of them with no intact families She found out what I found later on which was that these children have no resistance to very high level work and ideation In a quick take if you set the idiom aside they re producing work of a caliber that we associate with adults I know this must sound fantastic to your listeners but the truth is you and I could spend hours and not come to the end of people who ve accidentally stumbled on the great dirty secret of American schooling it just doesn t teach the way children learn nor can it be allowed to or maybe that s just momentum and not design We re dealing with a billion dollar a year industry it s the gatekeeper to all of the rest of the jobs We couldn t turn out an excess of competent people without really doing damage to this economy If this sounds like I m playing a conspiratorial string on my violin hardly the president of Columbia s teacher s college Dean Russell in in the keynote speech to the NEA said that there was a tremendous danger that too many leader s would be produced and it would cause a collapse in the system p p JB I m reading where a quote that you have in an article by you by Edward Roth in his book written in called quot Social Control quot says the following quot plans are on the way to replace community family and church with propaganda education and mass media People are only little plastic lumps of human dough quot Now you quote that I suppose because for you it encapsulates the underlying spirit of education in America p p JTG Yeah I actually used that in a book that s coming out in the summer called quot the Empty Child quot by Simon and Schuster Since they wouldn t give me the million words I needed I needed to find the most trenchant reflection of this attitude towards children that they re little plastic lumps of dough Roth of course is not just a professor of sociology he was one of the two or three people who created the American discipline of sociology And you also have a few years later Geddard of Princeton the head of the psychology department who said that standardized testing would function as a dunce cap making people aware of their inferiority making them reluctance to compete and even even reproduce themselves There s a current to this not a strain but a powerful central current right before the first world war reaching a tremendous visible crescendo sometime right after the second world war after which it disintegrated itself rather than provoking controversy as a duty thing and not talk about it p p I stumbled upon all of this while I was trying to figure out why on earth so many people appeared to have a vested interest in trying to stop me from doing what they knew worked in a school setting But I talked to each one of them individually they d admit that that quot its stupid but I have to do it because quot and then they d refer to the next highest person on the administrative ladder Eventually when we got the state education dept and I was able to talk to the people there they began referring to politicians not all politicians but certain politicians And when I spoke to some of their administrative assistants a few were honest enough to refer me to corps great foundations think tanks which were running this particular politician although this was hardly said but I heard that What we have done then displace authority over the lives of children into so many different hands many of those quite invisible that to approach this with a problem solving set of mind is really to frustrate yourself to death We re dealing with a system that s working exactly the way its supposed to work There are ways around that you can sabotage it like I did for many years and that works sometimes locally or parochially until you re caught You can sidestep it by sending your kids to some private schools but most private schools function the same way except that they re more cosmetic You can home school your children I mean they re a variety of ways around it but they re not all tackling the problem p p JB I want to ask you you said that anytime you do something that is right you get blocked Could you give me one example of what you did that was right and was blocked p p JTG Oh sure I ll give you the actual example that triggered my resignation and the op ed editorial in the wall street journal My school system that I continued to succeed in in the sense that my kids were succeeding including the kids that weren t supposed to succeed continued to move me into worse and worse school settings Until finally I ended up at the school that produced of the quot Central Park jogger quot rapists including a number of other distinctions And here using the essentially the same methods but it took a lot longer and I was an older man but using essentially the same methods the kids began to lose their quot kid quot quality and began to become people and have a vested interest in developing their minds and spirits and characters as far as they could When I saw this heartening response my method is then to offer more and more challenges and at some point a challenge to a kid is navigating in the adult world of reality that they see around them dimly p p I had arranged with the president of I ll call it quot Bell Telephone quot in New York to have my kids taken through to visit a telephone station in keeping with things that I had been doing for years At the moment that some executive was dispatched to pick up the kids at the school and take them to the station our principal raced to the door that very moment confronted me and said quot these kids can t go out they haven t filed the proper papers quot I said quot sure I did Jules I dropped those in your box hours ago quot He said quot the policies have changed it has to be done two week in advance sent to the district and approved quot And I said quot ok Jules the next time quot and he said quot No quot In front of some vice president of the phone company with the kids all assembled together At that point I realized that what happened was not an independent decision by the principal but rather a frantic attempt by the school district which happens to be on the Upper West Side of Manhattan In fact they were disturbed by the continued success of children who happened to be under my direction The truth is they could have been under anyone s direction who had followed the same sort of system dirt farmers would have followed years ago p p JB Now what did you do for the kids with the kids that triggered this kind of retaliatory response p p JTG Essentially I operated on a couple of really simple assumptions That this bizarre and disturbing behavior that kids not only poor kids but really prosperous kids in New York were producing was a direct result of their lives being stripped of significant experiences confined in these abstract cells for all of their natural youth and set a diet of low level abstractions Not even the challenging debate material or text that you would have find in a fourth or fifth grade in the middle of the th century I mean that stuff that is reserved for the quot gifted quot or quot talented quot kids The ones in high school are doing sixth or seventh grade work by a century ago s standards p p JB If I can read between the lines you deviated from the standard curriculum that the administration wanted p p JTG I put together what I call a quot guerrilla quot curriculum Jerry and that was composed of stuffing them with primary experiences as much as I could from an ad hoc basis when I would read the paper in the morning or the night before Any kind of news going on I would have advance permission and the kids would be dispatched to investigate One part of this was I brought a kind of seminar standard to the classroom We didn t have to understand I ll use Aristotle as an example we didn t have to understand everything Aristotle was driving at to be absolutely certain that a lively discussion shows that much of what he was driving at were current topics in kids minds Once they got over the barrier of the language gap which is extremely easy to do just like teaching reading is extremely easy to do California s example to the world notwithstanding p p JB OK So you got them into more challenging material in a way which would change based on day to day events in the environment The way the administration saw it this was not in the structure that the curriculum was designed but you get that this was the way to give reality and aliveness to the learning experience p p JTG You re quite right but I think that the dynamic at work is worth exploring because its not as simple as the administration opposing it What s happening is that each subordinate level that has to give permission is on thin ice So that the ball is passed and when the ball leaves the local precincts it s really passed between foundation project officers certain university staff policy people in Washington so that in fact the ball never returns to your court or when it does its invariably ringed around with so many restrictions by other people who are making a living I m not alleging that its conscious but it happens To the point that you don t want to do it anymore p p JB We re taking a break we re talking with John Taylor Gatto John when we get back I want you to comment on the curve marking on the curve in standardized testing as a way to imbed the growing inequality in our society This is Jerry Brown don t go away p p commercial break p p JB Would you comment on the idea that grading on the curve which I presume most schools do is a way to put in a type of bell curve social stratification that is increasingly being replicated in almost every part of America p p JTG The idea very very early on it comes out of Prussian Germany in a series of debates in the th debates that arose out of Prussia that essentially said a mathematical or mathematized predictable world is the best out of all possible things to hope for The big people to read if you ve read Hegel himself I think you d know all you d need to know In order to control everybody certain strategic courses were undertaken in forced schooling There had never been prior to Prussia in the early th century been successful forced schooling in the history of the planet And suddenly Prussia in drew in all of the children put them in a stage system The first stage was to trivialize the greatest learning time by filling it I realize that this is going to get the backs up of some of your listeners with balloons songs and funny games But to keep the intellectual moral part under the control of the teacher Somewhere in the age of the idea was to set everyone suddenly in competition with each other and produce visible marks of rank everyone so that no matter how secure you were in your understanding of something there would always be people you could see who had been visibly recognized as your masters And according to Hegel and a number of other thinkers this constant quot alienation quot that was the world they used which was translated directly to American schools this alimentation would lead to the kind of society which could be placed under the direction of certified experts that the state and the corporate world found safe and productive The net result of this Jerry was that Prussia a dirt poor country in or years was one of the world leaders The Prussian king decided the Canadian American border because he was the most prestigious monarch on earth Hartsman and every other founder of American schooling before we had compulsory schooling went to Prussia and came back with glowing reports of what the Prussians had produced that is to say a predictable society that could be run by the best minds p p What you see on a normal bell curve probably at a moment when assessment is the wrong thing to do its inappropriate people learn on private learning curves We know the point in which we cross the barrier and understand something Some people learn instantly certain things and others learn six years later I will tell you this a kid who learns to read at five and a kid who learns to read at will be indistinguishable to each other at the age of fourteen assuming they both like what they re doing On the other hand we can say its too inconvenient or too expensive to allow that and impose a learning curve in first grade that produces this wonderful bell we can then assign the people on the fringes of the bell to special ed and the people in the middle of the bells the walls of the curve to the dull classes and so on And we will create a class system by simply doing that Inside of a year or two the kids will impose that kind of class system on themselves It s a phenomenally intricate but rather easy to unravel puzzle there reading is pathetically easy to teach you assume that once you assemble people in a room and do it in the same routines that you ll fail to teach it to some of them that this bell will appear and the atmosphere in the classroom is that the humiliation of being a dull reader or bad reader will never wear off You can predict the rise of a giant remediation industry p p On the other hand I want your to compare it to or when the founder of the DuPont fortune wrote to investors in France and said there s a miracle going on in this country because everyone here can read and debate like a lawyer quot There s nobody who can t read and they re facile with numbers quot Or you can look at De Tocqueville s famous analysis when he said that the classical Greeks are children compared to these dirt farmer s kids Look at the best sellers of that day The Last of the Mohicans by James Fennimore Cooper I would urge your readers to get an uncut version of Last of the Mohicans especially if they have one or two college degrees and see what an impossible book it is to read And yet it sold the equivalent of million copies p p JB I notice that you re also saying that judging from the Army Intelligence Test that you have of the whites who can t read and of the African Americans who can t read p p JTG Its just amazing because just in these figures were just for the white group and for the African American group p p JB Do you believe John do you believe those numbers because they re very shocking Ouml p p JTG I believe those numbers from my own experience When you try to reconstruct the intellect of a tear old kid which is essentially what my classroom was about you re dealing with social resistance which is quite unbelievable yet I just got a call today from a kid who had criminal charges against him at and furthermore he was filed as a functional illiterate by the school He s working on his second college degree and trying to decide among offers which would make him leave academia This is a boy that wanted to have a gun at he s only about now So what miracle happened Well the miracle that happened was that he was given himself back and it didn t take a N Y teacher of the year to do that I m not claiming any particular insight other than what was common knowledge a century ago This country was unique in world history because it took ordinary people people who were considered trash in Europe and made them independent hard working self respecting people To deny what is unique about American history is just nuts because in there we have the skeleton key to unlock the problem of our schools p p JB My own grandmother I think went to school until the th grade she was quite a reader well into her s very well read Now we have a world in which this president is saying that we have to create a situation that everyone can have at least two years of college in the same way that I suppose that the th grade was assumed to be necessary at the beginning of the century p p JTG I hope that he s just a dupe Jerry I really hope so The way that the game works is that we say that the reason this problem exists is that A we don t have enough money and B we don t have enough of the kids lives to work on them So we ve watched schooling go from an average weeks and produce a totally literate nation p p JB weeks or years p p JTG weeks The truth is that nowhere in the US as late as nowhere did more than of the people go to school p p JB And when they went to school you re saying that they only went for weeks That s only a couple of months p p JTG And kids who went for longer than that didn t go every day or even every week So they came and went And furthermore they were under the control of one woman who had ages and class sizes of that s an impossible situation according to the way we do business today And yet as soon as you change the teacher student ratio from the teacher being of the solution and the student to the reverse of that the student of the solution the teacher then you can see how very large classes or mixed classes can work because the kids are responsible teaching each other p p JB What I m hearing here one of the key building blocks more important than TV in the development of a society of dependent obedient sheep like herdlike uncritical people is that the school is the mechanism of schooling enshrined as a secular religion So if the goal is independent thinking self reliance critical thinking all the good stuff that Abe Lincoln Benjamin Franklin held up as such important values then somehow this whole schooling mechanism needs to be smashed And I want to get that very clear because there is a childlike devotion to the school system that reminds me of the quot Devotion of the Blessed Mother quot at St Brendan s grammar school years ago p p JTG It was sold that way all of this the various media sold it this way I m not saying that there was a cabal but simply that it was the way it was presented to them Flattering luncheons where the decision has been made to take that wonderful woman who had run without an administration those one room schools which had done so well and put her under the direction of an apparatus of men not just a single layer but infinite layers which are still being spun out p p JB It almost sounds like the apparatchiks in the late stage Soviet Union p p JTG That s an excellent kernel The question is whether this grows naturally as a result of certain economic decision MIT makes mandatory I believe a book called quot Autonomous Technology quot by Langdon Winter written about years ago in which Winters says once you start with certain premises it is inevitable that the system will eventually control all the personnel the apparent leaders will remain only as long as they serve the system s purposes if they don t heir marginalized and gotten rid of and someone else is put in p p A lot of them that the family was the barrier to a sane future They may not have liked each other but they all agreed that you had to get children away from the family School was the mechanism to utopianize I think both things are at work here ideologues who communicate this idea and are able to perpetuate themselves from generation to generation They control hiring at universities and foundations and so on and look for people like themselves p p JB Today we get a report of Al Shanker s funeral a memorial Al Shanker being the head of the United Federation of Teachers of America probably the most powerful educator of this country And you have Senator Kennedy representing the Left wing of the remnant Democratic Party and you have former New York City mayor Ed Koch once a Democrat but now a populist corporatist conservative former New York mayor So you have a pretty wide spectrum at least on the left right spectrum giving real encomiums of adulation to the creative work of Shanker which as far as I know without speaking ill of the deceased Shanker was a pillar of this entire apparatus which you have been criticizing for the last minutes p p JTG He was Let me say not in Shanker s defense but an explanation of how Shanker managed to draw support from all portions of the political spectrum Shanker was to his credit very outspoken of the division that he represented Shanker is as close to being a classical old line socialist nor did he make any bones about that Shanker is on record a number of times saying that schools are not about the best destiny for the children schools are not about making Johnny s family stronger or bringing his parents in on the governance or deliberations I had dinner twice with Shanker I was at this small table with him and I must say that compared to everyone else at the table probably me included that Shanker absolutely said what was on his mind laughs Not that I agreed with him p p JB But that s the real issue what is on his mind and what s on America s mind is that the problem of America is that there is not enough education there s not enough getting to these poor people who are causing all of the crime or there s not enough in the middle to compete with the Japanese or the Chinese or all of those smart people And the answer is whether it s the market based people who have their strategy or the liberals who have theirs one way or another its to get these little kids more programs for the competitive world and not for the kind of disruptive individual critical thinking which I believe you re suggesting and that I certainly very much recommend p p break p p JB John I m going to read you something that you ve said and I m going to ask you how to attain what you re suggesting I quote quot We have to radically decentralize government corporate schooling return the power of designing and assessing programs to the local level and ensure that every form of training for the young aims at producing independent self reliant minds good characters and individuals who get fighting mad when called a quot human resource quot and told their main function is to be part of the work force Ok great I accept that so how do we get there Who do we attack and what do we build p p JTG The schema first has to be seen clearly as long as the economy is built up of very large corporations very large institutions and very large government agencies by necessity all the training that is approved leads towards some position on the pecking order of these giant employment pyramids I d like to jump from that to two groups who have never participated in that and who ve had a sort of blemished record of success I d like to do this to allow your listeners to independently verify that its possible p p Look at Johns Hopkins University not one of my favorite universities but they ve been tracking the Amish for a long time They ve published several I think mind blowing books about what has happened in Amish America In this century at the beginning of the century there were of these people now there are So the group itself has retained its integrity and grown times Second of the Amish or as close to that as humanly possible has independent livelihoods and its divided in small entrepreneurial businesses and in small farms Now consider the drawbacks these people labor under the government of Pennsylvania has been their sworn enemy through the century And they don t use telephones they don t use computers they don t use cars and they go to the sup th sup grade only because the Supreme Court cut a deal with them in the So with all these drawbacks you have a community that with all intents and purposes has no crime at all that takes care of old and young because it mixes both of those groups together in the life of the community is amazingly successful amazingly wealthy and amazingly unschooled Now many of your listeners or my friends who would no doubt say that it s that religious glue that pious glue that gives them the advantage So I d like to jump to the group that s resolutely militantly free thought probably as any that s ever existed p p And that s in the Basque country in Spain the north west of Spain and its forgive my accent the Mondragon Cooperative There s about the same number of these people as there are Amish and they aim for exactly the same grown up solution that everyone will have an independent livelihood or they ll be a part of a small group that makes its living proving to other people that it s valuable So their schooling is resolutely directed toward developing the kind of independent self reliant tough minded characteristics that oddly enough Amish education also stresses p p So here we have bracketed now two groups that are small but not that small who manage to keep what Lincoln s idea for America was Independent livelihood was where it was at You know back in the s s it was impossible to assemble an American work force over because people would only work for you long enough to get a little stake and then cut off and go off on their own When we look at the history of New England factories that they re going to concerts and dances and libraries for the young girls who worked there for just a couple of years until they could bring a little stake to their marriage That was the American dream that you could write the script to your own life And very very gradually that dream was converted and this is quite easy to track not by evil people but by people who understood that wealth depends on your ability to command labor And unless you can assemble large groups of labor you were never going to be wealthy as the Europeans reckoned wealth or the English reckoned wealth p p JB Ok John since we have a few callers on the line I d like to encapsulate what you re saying that the accumulation of great wealth requires the ability to command labor You cannot labor if its independent and critical therefore you need a schooling system much in the way that obedience school provides for dogs they have to be taught not to pee in the house or heel at their master s beck and call And in effect the entire school enterprise and there are obvious examples is a huge obedience school run on the kennel model And the two examples you ve given me Amish which is based on a character traditional very family based with a very god centered decentralized form and the other one which you refer to as secular is the worker owned cooperatives in the Basque land in Spain Two poles which are totally at variance with the consumer mass obedience operation which is cheerleaded from Jesse Jackson on the Left or Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan even more to the Left to you know the Right Wing folks the Moral Majority and the chamber of commerce p p So if I hear you right what we really have to face up to is the absolute need for a critical distancing from this whole status quo which seeps into our deepest aims p p JTG Absolutely that s a perfect abstract Notice that we can eliminate Marxist ideas that evil or venal people are doing this What is happened is that the people who are doing this have convinced themselves quot scientifically quot that this is the only that it can be This is what sociologist Thomas Malthus biologist Charles Darwin or chemist John Dalton all said This is what the book the Bell Curve a couple of years ago said This is the way wishes it to be it can t be any other way So they have to overlook Jaime Escalante in California or Marva Collins in Chicago or even John Taylor Gatto in New York They have to overlook the Basques they have to overlook the Amish because they don t fit that theory p p JB So John then I take it you have no objection to vouchers p p JTG Its not that I have no objection to vouchers there s a real danger built into vouchers and that is the same sort of surveillance over your kids lives will follow the voucher What we have to do and we re going to do it whether its allowed or now we have to begin to break the fealty to these enormous organizations whether they re government or corporate or institutions p p JB Ok let s take a few calls now Craig has been waiting go ahead Craig p p Craig Thank you for your recent programs with Susannah Shepherd and Grace Malone We are a home schooling family for many years and I guess in a sense I d like to explain why it is we home school I d like to start by recommending a book quot Teaching as a Subversive Activity quot by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner And I d would say that anyone who has an interest in this subject if you have not read that book consider yourself uneducated That book was written in didn t deal with home schooling but it does explains the need to raise children who do not just accept the unexamined assumptions of our society That impulse is out there across the country but its really at war against what seems to be a stronger approach to suppress that kind of approach I know there are exceptions there are good teachers who really want to educate kids in the truest sense of the term but they re fighting the system What I really want to say here is that the school system at its heart even though yes its their to in some sense to educate the children but at its heart its really there to break their spirits That is what I think all the time We ve had some experience with our own children for short periods of time at our local schools and its only confirmed and reinforced what we already thought we knew p p JB Thank you Craig very eloquent John p p JTG I d like to comment on what Craig said on breaking the spirit The most influential US commissioner of education that ever existed was William Torre Harris and in a book he wrote back in The Philosophy of Education he said that the purpose of schooling was to alienate children from their families their churches their neighborhoods and themselves I mean it wasn t a secret its just that people who walk their dogs or look at the sun come up in the morning they don t have time to read books called quot The Philosophy of Education quot laughs Of course that s what it s about p p JB Amazing p p JTG He was the only prominent school man who and I believe that s still true who was a house guest to the Rockefellers the Carnegies Harris brought German schooling to the US and made sure that it stuck p p JB All right let s take a call from Angel in New Jersey p p Angel Hi thank you both My question concerns what I seem to see as an apparent contradiction between the acknowledged purpose of the school systems as they now stand and the stated belief that they can in fact be altered without actually altering the primary purposes of society In other words with corporations wanting a docile work force with a government needing a military going overseas and to engage in practices that many would consider are against the very interests of the very people who are being asked to fight in that military why would you believe that under the current system that people who are in control of the schools ultimately the politicians would in fact want to change the system so that it would in fact produce critical thinkers p p JB Ok angel you ve just asked the question I think you re hitting it right on the head here you re going to need to change a lot more than just the schoolhouse p p JTG Angel let me speak to that One of the great ways that people are held in place by their own fear Because these enormous employment pyramids control the flow of money and even the flow of information around the whole country you might assume that nothing can be done about them The truth is they have almost no internal cohesion at all they hate each other Look how fast the soviet union came apart I would like to just tell you very quickly here that I sat with Jeane Kirkpatrick about two weeks before the first signs of the crack took place There were a few other people in the room and she said in that cold steely flinty voice of hers quot let me tell you that it won t be for a hundred years that you see a crack in the soviet union because they have a personal dossier of every citizen and they have mathematical ways of telling where the fault lines will appear quot And two weeks later of course it was dying and a short time after that it was dead p p JB Ok John John we ve got to break in One hour has gone by We ll do it again we ll do it again but we are out of time We ll come back to this topic again there s a lot more to dig in and there s a lot of people who want to talk about the public schools This is Jerry Brown for We the People thanks for

href archivestyle css head body h John Taylor Gatto br New York State Teacher of the Year Interview By Jerry Brown h h March h br p Jerry Brown Welcome to another edition of We The People this hour we re going to talk some more about learning education and schooling in its many variations To help us reflect more deeply on this question we have on a line from New York John Taylor Gatto he was named the New York Teacher of the Year in he was also named New York City Teacher of the Year in as well as He resigned from teaching during his state titled year and he s put out an op ed piece in the Wall St Journal and four months later he was honored by his former students in a program at Carnegie Hall called quot An Evening With John Taylor Gatto the Exhausted School quot He s written the book quot Dumbing Down the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schools quot p p So what should I call you not professor of course just John John welcome to the show Call me Jerry p p John Taylor Gatto Okay Governor I ll you Jerry p p Jerry Brown Ok It s a real pleasure I ve been reading some of your material and its certainly harkens back to a couple of major influences on my teaching or rather my school ideas one Ivan Illich and the other Paul Goodman I guess I got off the trail there in and I read the book quot Compulsory Mis education quot and I ve never quite been able to get the hang of school issues since p p John Taylor Gatto I know both of those writers and they ve had a big influence on me as well p p JB Well tell me John you ve been in the school business thirty odd years teaching in the public schools of New York so can you state here in the beginning what the problem is here with here People are just wringing their hands and it doesn t seem like anything is going to get better with the path that we re on p p JTG Well there s a lot of problems Jerry But I think they boil down to a quick slug of we don t teach the way children learn and because the business has become really a central part of the American economy you re really not allowed to teach the way children learn although any individual component in this system would admit privately that they wish they d allow you to do that You have the perfect example of that out your way an elderly Peruvian immigrant in a school near Los Angeles inside of four years had the best scores on the Advanced Placement Calculus Test I m sure he was an excellent teacher but that s really beside the point He was working with a group of kids with no mathematical tradition and very little literary tradition and inside of a short time Garfield High was the third ranking school in the US on the AP calculus Mr Escalante s fate is just fascinating he was harassed and hounded out the school They made it intolerable for him to stay p p In Chicago there s a black lady named Marva Collins working with black ghetto kids many of them with no intact families She found out what I found later on which was that these children have no resistance to very high level work and ideation In a quick take if you set the idiom aside they re producing work of a caliber that we associate with adults I know this must sound fantastic to your listeners but the truth is you and I could spend hours and not come to the end of people who ve accidentally stumbled on the great dirty secret of American schooling it just doesn t teach the way children learn nor can it be allowed to or maybe that s just momentum and not design We re dealing with a billion dollar a year industry it s the gatekeeper to all of the rest of the jobs We couldn t turn out an excess of competent people without really doing damage to this economy If this sounds like I m playing a conspiratorial string on my violin hardly the president of Columbia s teacher s college Dean Russell in in the keynote speech to the NEA said that there was a tremendous danger that too many leader s would be produced and it would cause a collapse in the system p p JB I m reading where a quote that you have in an article by you by Edward Roth in his book written in called quot Social Control quot says the following quot plans are on the way to replace community family and church with propaganda education and mass media People are only little plastic lumps of human dough quot Now you quote that I suppose because for you it encapsulates the underlying spirit of education in America p p JTG Yeah I actually used that in a book that s coming out in the summer called quot the Empty Child quot by Simon and Schuster Since they wouldn t give me the million words I needed I needed to find the most trenchant reflection of this attitude towards children that they re little plastic lumps of dough Roth of course is not just a professor of sociology he was one of the two or three people who created the American discipline of sociology And you also have a few years later Geddard of Princeton the head of the psychology department who said that standardized testing would function as a dunce cap making people aware of their inferiority making them reluctance to compete and even even reproduce themselves There s a current to this not a strain but a powerful central current right before the first world war reaching a tremendous visible crescendo sometime right after the second world war after which it disintegrated itself rather than provoking controversy as a duty thing and not talk about it p p I stumbled upon all of this while I was trying to figure out why on earth so many people appeared to have a vested interest in trying to stop me from doing what they knew worked in a school setting But I talked to each one of them individually they d admit that that quot its stupid but I have to do it because quot and then they d refer to the next highest person on the administrative ladder Eventually when we got the state education dept and I was able to talk to the people there they began referring to politicians not all politicians but certain politicians And when I spoke to some of their administrative assistants a few were honest enough to refer me to corps great foundations think tanks which were running this particular politician although this was hardly said but I heard that What we have done then displace authority over the lives of children into so many different hands many of those quite invisible that to approach this with a problem solving set of mind is really to frustrate yourself to death We re dealing with a system that s working exactly the way its supposed to work There are ways around that you can sabotage it like I did for many years and that works sometimes locally or parochially until you re caught You can sidestep it by sending your kids to some private schools but most private schools function the same way except that they re more cosmetic You can home school your children I mean they re a variety of ways around it but they re not all tackling the problem p p JB I want to ask you you said that anytime you do something that is right you get blocked Could you give me one example of what you did that was right and was blocked p p JTG Oh sure I ll give you the actual example that triggered my resignation and the op ed editorial in the wall street journal My school system that I continued to succeed in in the sense that my kids were succeeding including the kids that weren t supposed to succeed continued to move me into worse and worse school settings Until finally I ended up at the school that produced of the quot Central Park jogger quot rapists including a number of other distinctions And here using the essentially the same methods but it took a lot longer and I was an older man but using essentially the same methods the kids began to lose their quot kid quot quality and began to become people and have a vested interest in developing their minds and spirits and characters as far as they could When I saw this heartening response my method is then to offer more and more challenges and at some point a challenge to a kid is navigating in the adult world of reality that they see around them dimly p p I had arranged with the president of I ll call it quot Bell Telephone quot in New York to have my kids taken through to visit a telephone station in keeping with things that I had been doing for years At the moment that some executive was dispatched to pick up the kids at the school and take them to the station our principal raced to the door that very moment confronted me and said quot these kids can t go out they haven t filed the proper papers quot I said quot sure I did Jules I dropped those in your box hours ago quot He said quot the policies have changed it has to be done two week in advance sent to the district and approved quot And I said quot ok Jules the next time quot and he said quot No quot In front of some vice president of the phone company with the kids all assembled together At that point I realized that what happened was not an independent decision by the principal but rather a frantic attempt by the school district which happens to be on the Upper West Side of Manhattan In fact they were disturbed by the continued success of children who happened to be under my direction The truth is they could have been under anyone s direction who had followed the same sort of system dirt farmers would have followed years ago p p JB Now what did you do for the kids with the kids that triggered this kind of retaliatory response p p JTG Essentially I operated on a couple of really simple assumptions That this bizarre and disturbing behavior that kids not only poor kids but really prosperous kids in New York were producing was a direct result of their lives being stripped of significant experiences confined in these abstract cells for all of their natural youth and set a diet of low level abstractions Not even the challenging debate material or text that you would have find in a fourth or fifth grade in the middle of the th century I mean that stuff that is reserved for the quot gifted quot or quot talented quot kids The ones in high school are doing sixth or seventh grade work by a century ago s standards p p JB If I can read between the lines you deviated from the standard curriculum that the administration wanted p p JTG I put together what I call a quot guerrilla quot curriculum Jerry and that was composed of stuffing them with primary experiences as much as I could from an ad hoc basis when I would read the paper in the morning or the night before Any kind of news going on I would have advance permission and the kids would be dispatched to investigate One part of this was I brought a kind of seminar standard to the classroom We didn t have to understand I ll use Aristotle as an example we didn t have to understand everything Aristotle was driving at to be absolutely certain that a lively discussion shows that much of what he was driving at were current topics in kids minds Once they got over the barrier of the language gap which is extremely easy to do just like teaching reading is extremely easy to do California s example to the world notwithstanding p p JB OK So you got them into more challenging material in a way which would change based on day to day events in the environment The way the administration saw it this was not in the structure that the curriculum was designed but you get that this was the way to give reality and aliveness to the learning experience p p JTG You re quite right but I think that the dynamic at work is worth exploring because its not as simple as the administration opposing it What s happening is that each subordinate level that has to give permission is on thin ice So that the ball is passed and when the ball leaves the local precincts it s really passed between foundation project officers certain university staff policy people in Washington so that in fact the ball never returns to your court or when it does its invariably ringed around with so many restrictions by other people who are making a living I m not alleging that its conscious but it happens To the point that you don t want to do it anymore p p JB We re taking a break we re talking with John Taylor Gatto John when we get back I want you to comment on the curve marking on the curve in standardized testing as a way to imbed the growing inequality in our society This is Jerry Brown don t go away p p commercial break p p JB Would you comment on the idea that grading on the curve which I presume most schools do is a way to put in a type of bell curve social stratification that is increasingly being replicated in almost every part of America p p JTG The idea very very early on it comes out of Prussian Germany in a series of debates in the th debates that arose out of Prussia that essentially said a mathematical or mathematized predictable world is the best out of all possible things to hope for The big people to read if you ve read Hegel himself I think you d know all you d need to know In order to control everybody certain strategic courses were undertaken in forced schooling There had never been prior to Prussia in the early th century been successful forced schooling in the history of the planet And suddenly Prussia in drew in all of the children put them in a stage system The first stage was to trivialize the greatest learning time by filling it I realize that this is going to get the backs up of some of your listeners with balloons songs and funny games But to keep the intellectual moral part under the control of the teacher Somewhere in the age of the idea was to set everyone suddenly in competition with each other and produce visible marks of rank everyone so that no matter how secure you were in your understanding of something there would always be people you could see who had been visibly recognized as your masters And according to Hegel and a number of other thinkers this constant quot alienation quot that was the world they used which was translated directly to American schools this alimentation would lead to the kind of society which could be placed under the direction of certified experts that the state and the corporate world found safe and productive The net result of this Jerry was that Prussia a dirt poor country in or years was one of the world leaders The Prussian king decided the Canadian American border because he was the most prestigious monarch on earth Hartsman and every other founder of American schooling before we had compulsory schooling went to Prussia and came back with glowing reports of what the Prussians had produced that is to say a predictable society that could be run by the best minds p p What you see on a normal bell curve probably at a moment when assessment is the wrong thing to do its inappropriate people learn on private learning curves We know the point in which we cross the barrier and understand something Some people learn instantly certain things and others learn six years later I will tell you this a kid who learns to read at five and a kid who learns to read at will be indistinguishable to each other at the age of fourteen assuming they both like what they re doing On the other hand we can say its too inconvenient or too expensive to allow that and impose a learning curve in first grade that produces this wonderful bell we can then assign the people on the fringes of the bell to special ed and the people in the middle of the bells the walls of the curve to the dull classes and so on And we will create a class system by simply doing that Inside of a year or two the kids will impose that kind of class system on themselves It s a phenomenally intricate but rather easy to unravel puzzle there reading is pathetically easy to teach you assume that once you assemble people in a room and do it in the same routines that you ll fail to teach it to some of them that this bell will appear and the atmosphere in the classroom is that the humiliation of being a dull reader or bad reader will never wear off You can predict the rise of a giant remediation industry p p On the other hand I want your to compare it to or when the founder of the DuPont fortune wrote to investors in France and said there s a miracle going on in this country because everyone here can read and debate like a lawyer quot There s nobody who can t read and they re facile with numbers quot Or you can look at De Tocqueville s famous analysis when he said that the classical Greeks are children compared to these dirt farmer s kids Look at the best sellers of that day The Last of the Mohicans by James Fennimore Cooper I would urge your readers to get an uncut version of Last of the Mohicans especially if they have one or two college degrees and see what an impossible book it is to read And yet it sold the equivalent of million copies p p JB I notice that you re also saying that judging from the Army Intelligence Test that you have of the whites who can t read and of the African Americans who can t read p p JTG Its just amazing because just in these figures were just for the white group and for the African American group p p JB Do you believe John do you believe those numbers because they re very shocking Ouml p p JTG I believe those numbers from my own experience When you try to reconstruct the intellect of a tear old kid which is essentially what my classroom was about you re dealing with social resistance which is quite unbelievable yet I just got a call today from a kid who had criminal charges against him at and furthermore he was filed as a functional illiterate by the school He s working on his second college degree and trying to decide among offers which would make him leave academia This is a boy that wanted to have a gun at he s only about now So what miracle happened Well the miracle that happened was that he was given himself back and it didn t take a N Y teacher of the year to do that I m not claiming any particular insight other than what was common knowledge a century ago This country was unique in world history because it took ordinary people people who were considered trash in Europe and made them independent hard working self respecting people To deny what is unique about American history is just nuts because in there we have the skeleton key to unlock the problem of our schools p p JB My own grandmother I think went to school until the th grade she was quite a reader well into her s very well read Now we have a world in which this president is saying that we have to create a situation that everyone can have at least two years of college in the same way that I suppose that the th grade was assumed to be necessary at the beginning of the century p p JTG I hope that he s just a dupe Jerry I really hope so The way that the game works is that we say that the reason this problem exists is that A we don t have enough money and B we don t have enough of the kids lives to work on them So we ve watched schooling go from an average weeks and produce a totally literate nation p p JB weeks or years p p JTG weeks The truth is that nowhere in the US as late as nowhere did more than of the people go to school p p JB And when they went to school you re saying that they only went for weeks That s only a couple of months p p JTG And kids who went for longer than that didn t go every day or even every week So they came and went And furthermore they were under the control of one woman who had ages and class sizes of that s an impossible situation according to the way we do business today And yet as soon as you change the teacher student ratio from the teacher being of the solution and the student to the reverse of that the student of the solution the teacher then you can see how very large classes or mixed classes can work because the kids are responsible teaching each other p p JB What I m hearing here one of the key building blocks more important than TV in the development of a society of dependent obedient sheep like herdlike uncritical people is that the school is the mechanism of schooling enshrined as a secular religion So if the goal is independent thinking self reliance critical thinking all the good stuff that Abe Lincoln Benjamin Franklin held up as such important values then somehow this whole schooling mechanism needs to be smashed And I want to get that very clear because there is a childlike devotion to the school system that reminds me of the quot Devotion of the Blessed Mother quot at St Brendan s grammar school years ago p p JTG It was sold that way all of this the various media sold it this way I m not saying that there was a cabal but simply that it was the way it was presented to them Flattering luncheons where the decision has been made to take that wonderful woman who had run without an administration those one room schools which had done so well and put her under the direction of an apparatus of men not just a single layer but infinite layers which are still being spun out p p JB It almost sounds like the apparatchiks in the late stage Soviet Union p p JTG That s an excellent kernel The question is whether this grows naturally as a result of certain economic decision MIT makes mandatory I believe a book called quot Autonomous Technology quot by Langdon Winter written about years ago in which Winters says once you start with certain premises it is inevitable that the system will eventually control all the personnel the apparent leaders will remain only as long as they serve the system s purposes if they don t heir marginalized and gotten rid of and someone else is put in p p A lot of them that the family was the barrier to a sane future They may not have liked each other but they all agreed that you had to get children away from the family School was the mechanism to utopianize I think both things are at work here ideologues who communicate this idea and are able to perpetuate themselves from generation to generation They control hiring at universities and foundations and so on and look for people like themselves p p JB Today we get a report of Al Shanker s funeral a memorial Al Shanker being the head of the United Federation of Teachers of America probably the most powerful educator of this country And you have Senator Kennedy representing the Left wing of the remnant Democratic Party and you have former New York City mayor Ed Koch once a Democrat but now a populist corporatist conservative former New York mayor So you have a pretty wide spectrum at least on the left right spectrum giving real encomiums of adulation to the creative work of Shanker which as far as I know without speaking ill of the deceased Shanker was a pillar of this entire apparatus which you have been criticizing for the last minutes p p JTG He was Let me say not in Shanker s defense but an explanation of how Shanker managed to draw support from all portions of the political spectrum Shanker was to his credit very outspoken of the division that he represented Shanker is as close to being a classical old line socialist nor did he make any bones about that Shanker is on record a number of times saying that schools are not about the best destiny for the children schools are not about making Johnny s family stronger or bringing his parents in on the governance or deliberations I had dinner twice with Shanker I was at this small table with him and I must say that compared to everyone else at the table probably me included that Shanker absolutely said what was on his mind laughs Not that I agreed with him p p JB But that s the real issue what is on his mind and what s on America s mind is that the problem of America is that there is not enough education there s not enough getting to these poor people who are causing all of the crime or there s not enough in the middle to compete with the Japanese or the Chinese or all of those smart people And the answer is whether it s the market based people who have their strategy or the liberals who have theirs one way or another its to get these little kids more programs for the competitive world and not for the kind of disruptive individual critical thinking which I believe you re suggesting and that I certainly very much recommend p p break p p JB John I m going to read you something that you ve said and I m going to ask you how to attain what you re suggesting I quote quot We have to radically decentralize government corporate schooling return the power of designing and assessing programs to the local level and ensure that every form of training for the young aims at producing independent self reliant minds good characters and individuals who get fighting mad when called a quot human resource quot and told their main function is to be part of the work force Ok great I accept that so how do we get there Who do we attack and what do we build p p JTG The schema first has to be seen clearly as long as the economy is built up of very large corporations very large institutions and very large government agencies by necessity all the training that is approved leads towards some position on the pecking order of these giant employment pyramids I d like to jump from that to two groups who have never participated in that and who ve had a sort of blemished record of success I d like to do this to allow your listeners to independently verify that its possible p p Look at Johns Hopkins University not one of my favorite universities but they ve been tracking the Amish for a long time They ve published several I think mind blowing books about what has happened in Amish America In this century at the beginning of the century there were of these people now there are So the group itself has retained its integrity and grown times Second of the Amish or as close to that as humanly possible has independent livelihoods and its divided in small entrepreneurial businesses and in small farms Now consider the drawbacks these people labor under the government of Pennsylvania has been their sworn enemy through the century And they don t use telephones they don t use computers they don t use cars and they go to the sup th sup grade only because the Supreme Court cut a deal with them in the So with all these drawbacks you have a community that with all intents and purposes has no crime at all that takes care of old and young because it mixes both of those groups together in the life of the community is amazingly successful amazingly wealthy and amazingly unschooled Now many of your listeners or my friends who would no doubt say that it s that religious glue that pious glue that gives them the advantage So I d like to jump to the group that s resolutely militantly free thought probably as any that s ever existed p p And that s in the Basque country in Spain the north west of Spain and its forgive my accent the Mondragon Cooperative There s about the same number of these people as there are Amish and they aim for exactly the same grown up solution that everyone will have an independent livelihood or they ll be a part of a small group that makes its living proving to other people that it s valuable So their schooling is resolutely directed toward developing the kind of independent self reliant tough minded characteristics that oddly enough Amish education also stresses p p So here we have bracketed now two groups that are small but not that small who manage to keep what Lincoln s idea for America was Independent livelihood was where it was at You know back in the s s it was impossible to assemble an American work force over because people would only work for you long enough to get a little stake and then cut off and go off on their own When we look at the history of New England factories that they re going to concerts and dances and libraries for the young girls who worked there for just a couple of years until they could bring a little stake to their marriage That was the American dream that you could write the script to your own life And very very gradually that dream was converted and this is quite easy to track not by evil people but by people who understood that wealth depends on your ability to command labor And unless you can assemble large groups of labor you were never going to be wealthy as the Europeans reckoned wealth or the English reckoned wealth p p JB Ok John since we have a few callers on the line I d like to encapsulate what you re saying that the accumulation of great wealth requires the ability to command labor You cannot labor if its independent and critical therefore you need a schooling system much in the way that obedience school provides for dogs they have to be taught not to pee in the house or heel at their master s beck and call And in effect the entire school enterprise and there are obvious examples is a huge obedience school run on the kennel model And the two examples you ve given me Amish which is based on a character traditional very family based with a very god centered decentralized form and the other one which you refer to as secular is the worker owned cooperatives in the Basque land in Spain Two poles which are totally at variance with the consumer mass obedience operation which is cheerleaded from Jesse Jackson on the Left or Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan even more to the Left to you know the Right Wing folks the Moral Majority and the chamber of commerce p p So if I hear you right what we really have to face up to is the absolute need for a critical distancing from this whole status quo which seeps into our deepest aims p p JTG Absolutely that s a perfect abstract Notice that we can eliminate Marxist ideas that evil or venal people are doing this What is happened is that the people who are doing this have convinced themselves quot scientifically quot that this is the only that it can be This is what sociologist Thomas Malthus biologist Charles Darwin or chemist John Dalton all said This is what the book the Bell Curve a couple of years ago said This is the way wishes it to be it can t be any other way So they have to overlook Jaime Escalante in California or Marva Collins in Chicago or even John Taylor Gatto in New York They have to overlook the Basques they have to overlook the Amish because they don t fit that theory p p JB So John then I take it you have no objection to vouchers p p JTG Its not that I have no objection to vouchers there s a real danger built into vouchers and that is the same sort of surveillance over your kids lives will follow the voucher What we have to do and we re going to do it whether its allowed or now we have to begin to break the fealty to these enormous organizations whether they re government or corporate or institutions p p JB Ok let s take a few calls now Craig has been waiting go ahead Craig p p Craig Thank you for your recent programs with Susannah Shepherd and Grace Malone We are a home schooling family for many years and I guess in a sense I d like to explain why it is we home school I d like to start by recommending a book quot Teaching as a Subversive Activity quot by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner And I d would say that anyone who has an interest in this subject if you have not read that book consider yourself uneducated That book was written in didn t deal with home schooling but it does explains the need to raise children who do not just accept the unexamined assumptions of our society That impulse is out there across the country but its really at war against what seems to be a stronger approach to suppress that kind of approach I know there are exceptions there are good teachers who really want to educate kids in the truest sense of the term but they re fighting the system What I really want to say here is that the school system at its heart even though yes its their to in some sense to educate the children but at its heart its really there to break their spirits That is what I think all the time We ve had some experience with our own children for short periods of time at our local schools and its only confirmed and reinforced what we already thought we knew p p JB Thank you Craig very eloquent John p p JTG I d like to comment on what Craig said on breaking the spirit The most influential US commissioner of education that ever existed was William Torre Harris and in a book he wrote back in The Philosophy of Education he said that the purpose of schooling was to alienate children from their families their churches their neighborhoods and themselves I mean it wasn t a secret its just that people who walk their dogs or look at the sun come up in the morning they don t have time to read books called quot The Philosophy of Education quot laughs Of course that s what it s about p p JB Amazing p p JTG He was the only prominent school man who and I believe that s still true who was a house guest to the Rockefellers the Carnegies Harris brought German schooling to the US and made sure that it stuck p p JB All right let s take a call from Angel in New Jersey p p Angel Hi thank you both My question concerns what I seem to see as an apparent contradiction between the acknowledged purpose of the school systems as they now stand and the stated belief that they can in fact be altered without actually altering the primary purposes of society In other words with corporations wanting a docile work force with a government needing a military going overseas and to engage in practices that many would consider are against the very interests of the very people who are being asked to fight in that military why would you believe that under the current system that people who are in control of the schools ultimately the politicians would in fact want to change the system so that it would in fact produce critical thinkers p p JB Ok angel you ve just asked the question I think you re hitting it right on the head here you re going to need to change a lot more than just the schoolhouse p p JTG Angel let me speak to that One of the great ways that people are held in place by their own fear Because these enormous employment pyramids control the flow of money and even the flow of information around the whole country you might assume that nothing can be done about them The truth is they have almost no internal cohesion at all they hate each other Look how fast the soviet union came apart I would like to just tell you very quickly here that I sat with Jeane Kirkpatrick about two weeks before the first signs of the crack took place There were a few other people in the room and she said in that cold steely flinty voice of hers quot let me tell you that it won t be for a hundred years that you see a crack in the soviet union because they have a personal dossier of every citizen and they have mathematical ways of telling where the fault lines will appear quot And two weeks later of course it was dying and a short time after that it was dead p p JB Ok John John we ve got to break in One hour has gone by We ll do it again we ll do it again but we are out of time We ll come back to this topic again there s a lot more to dig in and there s a lot of people who want to talk about the public schools This is Jerry Brown for We the People thanks for

href archivestyle css head body h John Taylor Gatto br New York State Teacher of the Year Interview By Jerry Brown h h March h br p Jerry Brown Welcome to another edition of We The People this hour we re going to talk some more about learning education and schooling in its many variations To help us reflect more deeply on this question we have on a line from New York John Taylor Gatto he was named the New York Teacher of the Year in he was also named New York City Teacher of the Year in as well as He resigned from teaching during his state titled year and he s put out an op ed piece in the Wall St Journal and four months later he was honored by his former students in a program at Carnegie Hall called quot An Evening With John Taylor Gatto the Exhausted School quot He s written the book quot Dumbing Down the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schools quot p p So what should I call you not professor of course just John John welcome to the show Call me Jerry p p John Taylor Gatto Okay Governor I ll you Jerry p p Jerry Brown Ok It s a real pleasure I ve been reading some of your material and its certainly harkens back to a couple of major influences on my teaching or rather my school ideas one Ivan Illich and the other Paul Goodman I guess I got off the trail there in and I read the book quot Compulsory Mis education quot and I ve never quite been able to get the hang of school issues since p p John Taylor Gatto I know both of those writers and they ve had a big influence on me as well p p JB Well tell me John you ve been in the school business thirty odd years teaching in the public schools of New York so can you state here in the beginning what the problem is here with here People are just wringing their hands and it doesn t seem like anything is going to get better with the path that we re on p p JTG Well there s a lot of problems Jerry But I think they boil down to a quick slug of we don t teach the way children learn and because the business has become really a central part of the American economy you re really not allowed to teach the way children learn although any individual component in this system would admit privately that they wish they d allow you to do that You have the perfect example of that out your way an elderly Peruvian immigrant in a school near Los Angeles inside of four years had the best scores on the Advanced Placement Calculus Test I m sure he was an excellent teacher but that s really beside the point He was working with a group of kids with no mathematical tradition and very little literary tradition and inside of a short time Garfield High was the third ranking school in the US on the AP calculus Mr Escalante s fate is just fascinating he was harassed and hounded out the school They made it intolerable for him to stay p p In Chicago there s a black lady named Marva Collins working with black ghetto kids many of them with no intact families She found out what I found later on which was that these children have no resistance to very high level work and ideation In a quick take if you set the idiom aside they re producing work of a caliber that we associate with adults I know this must sound fantastic to your listeners but the truth is you and I could spend hours and not come to the end of people who ve accidentally stumbled on the great dirty secret of American schooling it just doesn t teach the way children learn nor can it be allowed to or maybe that s just momentum and not design We re dealing with a billion dollar a year industry it s the gatekeeper to all of the rest of the jobs We couldn t turn out an excess of competent people without really doing damage to this economy If this sounds like I m playing a conspiratorial string on my violin hardly the president of Columbia s teacher s college Dean Russell in in the keynote speech to the NEA said that there was a tremendous danger that too many leader s would be produced and it would cause a collapse in the system p p JB I m reading where a quote that you have in an article by you by Edward Roth in his book written in called quot Social Control quot says the following quot plans are on the way to replace community family and church with propaganda education and mass media People are only little plastic lumps of human dough quot Now you quote that I suppose because for you it encapsulates the underlying spirit of education in America p p JTG Yeah I actually used that in a book that s coming out in the summer called quot the Empty Child quot by Simon and Schuster Since they wouldn t give me the million words I needed I needed to find the most trenchant reflection of this attitude towards children that they re little plastic lumps of dough Roth of course is not just a professor of sociology he was one of the two or three people who created the American discipline of sociology And you also have a few years later Geddard of Princeton the head of the psychology department who said that standardized testing would function as a dunce cap making people aware of their inferiority making them reluctance to compete and even even reproduce themselves There s a current to this not a strain but a powerful central current right before the first world war reaching a tremendous visible crescendo sometime right after the second world war after which it disintegrated itself rather than provoking controversy as a duty thing and not talk about it p p I stumbled upon all of this while I was trying to figure out why on earth so many people appeared to have a vested interest in trying to stop me from doing what they knew worked in a school setting But I talked to each one of them individually they d admit that that quot its stupid but I have to do it because quot and then they d refer to the next highest person on the administrative ladder Eventually when we got the state education dept and I was able to talk to the people there they began referring to politicians not all politicians but certain politicians And when I spoke to some of their administrative assistants a few were honest enough to refer me to corps great foundations think tanks which were running this particular politician although this was hardly said but I heard that What we have done then displace authority over the lives of children into so many different hands many of those quite invisible that to approach this with a problem solving set of mind is really to frustrate yourself to death We re dealing with a system that s working exactly the way its supposed to work There are ways around that you can sabotage it like I did for many years and that works sometimes locally or parochially until you re caught You can sidestep it by sending your kids to some private schools but most private schools function the same way except that they re more cosmetic You can home school your children I mean they re a variety of ways around it but they re not all tackling the problem p p JB I want to ask you you said that anytime you do something that is right you get blocked Could you give me one example of what you did that was right and was blocked p p JTG Oh sure I ll give you the actual example that triggered my resignation and the op ed editorial in the wall street journal My school system that I continued to succeed in in the sense that my kids were succeeding including the kids that weren t supposed to succeed continued to move me into worse and worse school settings Until finally I ended up at the school that produced of the quot Central Park jogger quot rapists including a number of other distinctions And here using the essentially the same methods but it took a lot longer and I was an older man but using essentially the same methods the kids began to lose their quot kid quot quality and began to become people and have a vested interest in developing their minds and spirits and characters as far as they could When I saw this heartening response my method is then to offer more and more challenges and at some point a challenge to a kid is navigating in the adult world of reality that they see around them dimly p p I had arranged with the president of I ll call it quot Bell Telephone quot in New York to have my kids taken through to visit a telephone station in keeping with things that I had been doing for years At the moment that some executive was dispatched to pick up the kids at the school and take them to the station our principal raced to the door that very moment confronted me and said quot these kids can t go out they haven t filed the proper papers quot I said quot sure I did Jules I dropped those in your box hours ago quot He said quot the policies have changed it has to be done two week in advance sent to the district and approved quot And I said quot ok Jules the next time quot and he said quot No quot In front of some vice president of the phone company with the kids all assembled together At that point I realized that what happened was not an independent decision by the principal but rather a frantic attempt by the school district which happens to be on the Upper West Side of Manhattan In fact they were disturbed by the continued success of children who happened to be under my direction The truth is they could have been under anyone s direction who had followed the same sort of system dirt farmers would have followed years ago p p JB Now what did you do for the kids with the kids that triggered this kind of retaliatory response p p JTG Essentially I operated on a couple of really simple assumptions That this bizarre and disturbing behavior that kids not only poor kids but really prosperous kids in New York were producing was a direct result of their lives being stripped of significant experiences confined in these abstract cells for all of their natural youth and set a diet of low level abstractions Not even the challenging debate material or text that you would have find in a fourth or fifth grade in the middle of the th century I mean that stuff that is reserved for the quot gifted quot or quot talented quot kids The ones in high school are doing sixth or seventh grade work by a century ago s standards p p JB If I can read between the lines you deviated from the standard curriculum that the administration wanted p p JTG I put together what I call a quot guerrilla quot curriculum Jerry and that was composed of stuffing them with primary experiences as much as I could from an ad hoc basis when I would read the paper in the morning or the night before Any kind of news going on I would have advance permission and the kids would be dispatched to investigate One part of this was I brought a kind of seminar standard to the classroom We didn t have to understand I ll use Aristotle as an example we didn t have to understand everything Aristotle was driving at to be absolutely certain that a lively discussion shows that much of what he was driving at were current topics in kids minds Once they got over the barrier of the language gap which is extremely easy to do just like teaching reading is extremely easy to do California s example to the world notwithstanding p p JB OK So you got them into more challenging material in a way which would change based on day to day events in the environment The way the administration saw it this was not in the structure that the curriculum was designed but you get that this was the way to give reality and aliveness to the learning experience p p JTG You re quite right but I think that the dynamic at work is worth exploring because its not as simple as the administration opposing it What s happening is that each subordinate level that has to give permission is on thin ice So that the ball is passed and when the ball leaves the local precincts it s really passed between foundation project officers certain university staff policy people in Washington so that in fact the ball never returns to your court or when it does its invariably ringed around with so many restrictions by other people who are making a living I m not alleging that its conscious but it happens To the point that you don t want to do it anymore p p JB We re taking a break we re talking with John Taylor Gatto John when we get back I want you to comment on the curve marking on the curve in standardized testing as a way to imbed the growing inequality in our society This is Jerry Brown don t go away p p commercial break p p JB Would you comment on the idea that grading on the curve which I presume most schools do is a way to put in a type of bell curve social stratification that is increasingly being replicated in almost every part of America p p JTG The idea very very early on it comes out of Prussian Germany in a series of debates in the th debates that arose out of Prussia that essentially said a mathematical or mathematized predictable world is the best out of all possible things to hope for The big people to read if you ve read Hegel himself I think you d know all you d need to know In order to control everybody certain strategic courses were undertaken in forced schooling There had never been prior to Prussia in the early th century been successful forced schooling in the history of the planet And suddenly Prussia in drew in all of the children put them in a stage system The first stage was to trivialize the greatest learning time by filling it I realize that this is going to get the backs up of some of your listeners with balloons songs and funny games But to keep the intellectual moral part under the control of the teacher Somewhere in the age of the idea was to set everyone suddenly in competition with each other and produce visible marks of rank everyone so that no matter how secure you were in your understanding of something there would always be people you could see who had been visibly recognized as your masters And according to Hegel and a number of other thinkers this constant quot alienation quot that was the world they used which was translated directly to American schools this alimentation would lead to the kind of society which could be placed under the direction of certified experts that the state and the corporate world found safe and productive The net result of this Jerry was that Prussia a dirt poor country in or years was one of the world leaders The Prussian king decided the Canadian American border because he was the most prestigious monarch on earth Hartsman and every other founder of American schooling before we had compulsory schooling went to Prussia and came back with glowing reports of what the Prussians had produced that is to say a predictable society that could be run by the best minds p p What you see on a normal bell curve probably at a moment when assessment is the wrong thing to do its inappropriate people learn on private learning curves We know the point in which we cross the barrier and understand something Some people learn instantly certain things and others learn six years later I will tell you this a kid who learns to read at five and a kid who learns to read at will be indistinguishable to each other at the age of fourteen assuming they both like what they re doing On the other hand we can say its too inconvenient or too expensive to allow that and impose a learning curve in first grade that produces this wonderful bell we can then assign the people on the fringes of the bell to special ed and the people in the middle of the bells the walls of the curve to the dull classes and so on And we will create a class system by simply doing that Inside of a year or two the kids will impose that kind of class system on themselves It s a phenomenally intricate but rather easy to unravel puzzle there reading is pathetically easy to teach you assume that once you assemble people in a room and do it in the same routines that you ll fail to teach it to some of them that this bell will appear and the atmosphere in the classroom is that the humiliation of being a dull reader or bad reader will never wear off You can predict the rise of a giant remediation industry p p On the other hand I want your to compare it to or when the founder of the DuPont fortune wrote to investors in France and said there s a miracle going on in this country because everyone here can read and debate like a lawyer quot There s nobody who can t read and they re facile with numbers quot Or you can look at De Tocqueville s famous analysis when he said that the classical Greeks are children compared to these dirt farmer s kids Look at the best sellers of that day The Last of the Mohicans by James Fennimore Cooper I would urge your readers to get an uncut version of Last of the Mohicans especially if they have one or two college degrees and see what an impossible book it is to read And yet it sold the equivalent of million copies p p JB I notice that you re also saying that judging from the Army Intelligence Test that you have of the whites who can t read and of the African Americans who can t read p p JTG Its just amazing because just in these figures were just for the white group and for the African American group p p JB Do you believe John do you believe those numbers because they re very shocking Ouml p p JTG I believe those numbers from my own experience When you try to reconstruct the intellect of a tear old kid which is essentially what my classroom was about you re dealing with social resistance which is quite unbelievable yet I just got a call today from a kid who had criminal charges against him at and furthermore he was filed as a functional illiterate by the school He s working on his second college degree and trying to decide among offers which would make him leave academia This is a boy that wanted to have a gun at he s only about now So what miracle happened Well the miracle that happened was that he was given himself back and it didn t take a N Y teacher of the year to do that I m not claiming any particular insight other than what was common knowledge a century ago This country was unique in world history because it took ordinary people people who were considered trash in Europe and made them independent hard working self respecting people To deny what is unique about American history is just nuts because in there we have the skeleton key to unlock the problem of our schools p p JB My own grandmother I think went to school until the th grade she was quite a reader well into her s very well read Now we have a world in which this president is saying that we have to create a situation that everyone can have at least two years of college in the same way that I suppose that the th grade was assumed to be necessary at the beginning of the century p p JTG I hope that he s just a dupe Jerry I really hope so The way that the game works is that we say that the reason this problem exists is that A we don t have enough money and B we don t have enough of the kids lives to work on them So we ve watched schooling go from an average weeks and produce a totally literate nation p p JB weeks or years p p JTG weeks The truth is that nowhere in the US as late as nowhere did more than of the people go to school p p JB And when they went to school you re saying that they only went for weeks That s only a couple of months p p JTG And kids who went for longer than that didn t go every day or even every week So they came and went And furthermore they were under the control of one woman who had ages and class sizes of that s an impossible situation according to the way we do business today And yet as soon as you change the teacher student ratio from the teacher being of the solution and the student to the reverse of that the student of the solution the teacher then you can see how very large classes or mixed classes can work because the kids are responsible teaching each other p p JB What I m hearing here one of the key building blocks more important than TV in the development of a society of dependent obedient sheep like herdlike uncritical people is that the school is the mechanism of schooling enshrined as a secular religion So if the goal is independent thinking self reliance critical thinking all the good stuff that Abe Lincoln Benjamin Franklin held up as such important values then somehow this whole schooling mechanism needs to be smashed And I want to get that very clear because there is a childlike devotion to the school system that reminds me of the quot Devotion of the Blessed Mother quot at St Brendan s grammar school years ago p p JTG It was sold that way all of this the various media sold it this way I m not saying that there was a cabal but simply that it was the way it was presented to them Flattering luncheons where the decision has been made to take that wonderful woman who had run without an administration those one room schools which had done so well and put her under the direction of an apparatus of men not just a single layer but infinite layers which are still being spun out p p JB It almost sounds like the apparatchiks in the late stage Soviet Union p p JTG That s an excellent kernel The question is whether this grows naturally as a result of certain economic decision MIT makes mandatory I believe a book called quot Autonomous Technology quot by Langdon Winter written about years ago in which Winters says once you start with certain premises it is inevitable that the system will eventually control all the personnel the apparent leaders will remain only as long as they serve the system s purposes if they don t heir marginalized and gotten rid of and someone else is put in p p A lot of them that the family was the barrier to a sane future They may not have liked each other but they all agreed that you had to get children away from the family School was the mechanism to utopianize I think both things are at work here ideologues who communicate this idea and are able to perpetuate themselves from generation to generation They control hiring at universities and foundations and so on and look for people like themselves p p JB Today we get a report of Al Shanker s funeral a memorial Al Shanker being the head of the United Federation of Teachers of America probably the most powerful educator of this country And you have Senator Kennedy representing the Left wing of the remnant Democratic Party and you have former New York City mayor Ed Koch once a Democrat but now a populist corporatist conservative former New York mayor So you have a pretty wide spectrum at least on the left right spectrum giving real encomiums of adulation to the creative work of Shanker which as far as I know without speaking ill of the deceased Shanker was a pillar of this entire apparatus which you have been criticizing for the last minutes p p JTG He was Let me say not in Shanker s defense but an explanation of how Shanker managed to draw support from all portions of the political spectrum Shanker was to his credit very outspoken of the division that he represented Shanker is as close to being a classical old line socialist nor did he make any bones about that Shanker is on record a number of times saying that schools are not about the best destiny for the children schools are not about making Johnny s family stronger or bringing his parents in on the governance or deliberations I had dinner twice with Shanker I was at this small table with him and I must say that compared to everyone else at the table probably me included that Shanker absolutely said what was on his mind laughs Not that I agreed with him p p JB But that s the real issue what is on his mind and what s on America s mind is that the problem of America is that there is not enough education there s not enough getting to these poor people who are causing all of the crime or there s not enough in the middle to compete with the Japanese or the Chinese or all of those smart people And the answer is whether it s the market based people who have their strategy or the liberals who have theirs one way or another its to get these little kids more programs for the competitive world and not for the kind of disruptive individual critical thinking which I believe you re suggesting and that I certainly very much recommend p p break p p JB John I m going to read you something that you ve said and I m going to ask you how to attain what you re suggesting I quote quot We have to radically decentralize government corporate schooling return the power of designing and assessing programs to the local level and ensure that every form of training for the young aims at producing independent self reliant minds good characters and individuals who get fighting mad when called a quot human resource quot and told their main function is to be part of the work force Ok great I accept that so how do we get there Who do we attack and what do we build p p JTG The schema first has to be seen clearly as long as the economy is built up of very large corporations very large institutions and very large government agencies by necessity all the training that is approved leads towards some position on the pecking order of these giant employment pyramids I d like to jump from that to two groups who have never participated in that and who ve had a sort of blemished record of success I d like to do this to allow your listeners to independently verify that its possible p p Look at Johns Hopkins University not one of my favorite universities but they ve been tracking the Amish for a long time They ve published several I think mind blowing books about what has happened in Amish America In this century at the beginning of the century there were of these people now there are So the group itself has retained its integrity and grown times Second of the Amish or as close to that as humanly possible has independent livelihoods and its divided in small entrepreneurial businesses and in small farms Now consider the drawbacks these people labor under the government of Pennsylvania has been their sworn enemy through the century And they don t use telephones they don t use computers they don t use cars and they go to the sup th sup grade only because the Supreme Court cut a deal with them in the So with all these drawbacks you have a community that with all intents and purposes has no crime at all that takes care of old and young because it mixes both of those groups together in the life of the community is amazingly successful amazingly wealthy and amazingly unschooled Now many of your listeners or my friends who would no doubt say that it s that religious glue that pious glue that gives them the advantage So I d like to jump to the group that s resolutely militantly free thought probably as any that s ever existed p p And that s in the Basque country in Spain the north west of Spain and its forgive my accent the Mondragon Cooperative There s about the same number of these people as there are Amish and they aim for exactly the same grown up solution that everyone will have an independent livelihood or they ll be a part of a small group that makes its living proving to other people that it s valuable So their schooling is resolutely directed toward developing the kind of independent self reliant tough minded characteristics that oddly enough Amish education also stresses p p So here we have bracketed now two groups that are small but not that small who manage to keep what Lincoln s idea for America was Independent livelihood was where it was at You know back in the s s it was impossible to assemble an American work force over because people would only work for you long enough to get a little stake and then cut off and go off on their own When we look at the history of New England factories that they re going to concerts and dances and libraries for the young girls who worked there for just a couple of years until they could bring a little stake to their marriage That was the American dream that you could write the script to your own life And very very gradually that dream was converted and this is quite easy to track not by evil people but by people who understood that wealth depends on your ability to command labor And unless you can assemble large groups of labor you were never going to be wealthy as the Europeans reckoned wealth or the English reckoned wealth p p JB Ok John since we have a few callers on the line I d like to encapsulate what you re saying that the accumulation of great wealth requires the ability to command labor You cannot labor if its independent and critical therefore you need a schooling system much in the way that obedience school provides for dogs they have to be taught not to pee in the house or heel at their master s beck and call And in effect the entire school enterprise and there are obvious examples is a huge obedience school run on the kennel model And the two examples you ve given me Amish which is based on a character traditional very family based with a very god centered decentralized form and the other one which you refer to as secular is the worker owned cooperatives in the Basque land in Spain Two poles which are totally at variance with the consumer mass obedience operation which is cheerleaded from Jesse Jackson on the Left or Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan even more to the Left to you know the Right Wing folks the Moral Majority and the chamber of commerce p p So if I hear you right what we really have to face up to is the absolute need for a critical distancing from this whole status quo which seeps into our deepest aims p p JTG Absolutely that s a perfect abstract Notice that we can eliminate Marxist ideas that evil or venal people are doing this What is happened is that the people who are doing this have convinced themselves quot scientifically quot that this is the only that it can be This is what sociologist Thomas Malthus biologist Charles Darwin or chemist John Dalton all said This is what the book the Bell Curve a couple of years ago said This is the way wishes it to be it can t be any other way So they have to overlook Jaime Escalante in California or Marva Collins in Chicago or even John Taylor Gatto in New York They have to overlook the Basques they have to overlook the Amish because they don t fit that theory p p JB So John then I take it you have no objection to vouchers p p JTG Its not that I have no objection to vouchers there s a real danger built into vouchers and that is the same sort of surveillance over your kids lives will follow the voucher What we have to do and we re going to do it whether its allowed or now we have to begin to break the fealty to these enormous organizations whether they re government or corporate or institutions p p JB Ok let s take a few calls now Craig has been waiting go ahead Craig p p Craig Thank you for your recent programs with Susannah Shepherd and Grace Malone We are a home schooling family for many years and I guess in a sense I d like to explain why it is we home school I d like to start by recommending a book quot Teaching as a Subversive Activity quot by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner And I d would say that anyone who has an interest in this subject if you have not read that book consider yourself uneducated That book was written in didn t deal with home schooling but it does explains the need to raise children who do not just accept the unexamined assumptions of our society That impulse is out there across the country but its really at war against what seems to be a stronger approach to suppress that kind of approach I know there are exceptions there are good teachers who really want to educate kids in the truest sense of the term but they re fighting the system What I really want to say here is that the school system at its heart even though yes its their to in some sense to educate the children but at its heart its really there to break their spirits That is what I think all the time We ve had some experience with our own children for short periods of time at our local schools and its only confirmed and reinforced what we already thought we knew p p JB Thank you Craig very eloquent John p p JTG I d like to comment on what Craig said on breaking the spirit The most influential US commissioner of education that ever existed was William Torre Harris and in a book he wrote back in The Philosophy of Education he said that the purpose of schooling was to alienate children from their families their churches their neighborhoods and themselves I mean it wasn t a secret its just that people who walk their dogs or look at the sun come up in the morning they don t have time to read books called quot The Philosophy of Education quot laughs Of course that s what it s about p p JB Amazing p p JTG He was the only prominent school man who and I believe that s still true who was a house guest to the Rockefellers the Carnegies Harris brought German schooling to the US and made sure that it stuck p p JB All right let s take a call from Angel in New Jersey p p Angel Hi thank you both My question concerns what I seem to see as an apparent contradiction between the acknowledged purpose of the school systems as they now stand and the stated belief that they can in fact be altered without actually altering the primary purposes of society In other words with corporations wanting a docile work force with a government needing a military going overseas and to engage in practices that many would consider are against the very interests of the very people who are being asked to fight in that military why would you believe that under the current system that people who are in control of the schools ultimately the politicians would in fact want to change the system so that it would in fact produce critical thinkers p p JB Ok angel you ve just asked the question I think you re hitting it right on the head here you re going to need to change a lot more than just the schoolhouse p p JTG Angel let me speak to that One of the great ways that people are held in place by their own fear Because these enormous employment pyramids control the flow of money and even the flow of information around the whole country you might assume that nothing can be done about them The truth is they have almost no internal cohesion at all they hate each other Look how fast the soviet union came apart I would like to just tell you very quickly here that I sat with Jeane Kirkpatrick about two weeks before the first signs of the crack took place There were a few other people in the room and she said in that cold steely flinty voice of hers quot let me tell you that it won t be for a hundred years that you see a crack in the soviet union because they have a personal dossier of every citizen and they have mathematical ways of telling where the fault lines will appear quot And two weeks later of course it was dying and a short time after that it was dead p p JB Ok John John we ve got to break in One hour has gone by We ll do it again we ll do it again but we are out of time We ll come back to this topic again there s a lot more to dig in and there s a lot of people who want to talk about the public schools This is Jerry Brown for We the People thanks for

href archivestyle css head body h John Taylor Gatto br New York State Teacher of the Year Interview By Jerry Brown h h March h br p Jerry Brown Welcome to another edition of We The People this hour we re going to talk some more about learning education and schooling in its many variations To help us reflect more deeply on this question we have on a line from New York John Taylor Gatto he was named the New York Teacher of the Year in he was also named New York City Teacher of the Year in as well as He resigned from teaching during his state titled year and he s put out an op ed piece in the Wall St Journal and four months later he was honored by his former students in a program at Carnegie Hall called quot An Evening With John Taylor Gatto the Exhausted School quot He s written the book quot Dumbing Down the Hidden Curriculum of Compulsory Schools quot p p So what should I call you not professor of course just John John welcome to the show Call me Jerry p p John Taylor Gatto Okay Governor I ll you Jerry p p Jerry Brown Ok It s a real pleasure I ve been reading some of your material and its certainly harkens back to a couple of major influences on my teaching or rather my school ideas one Ivan Illich and the other Paul Goodman I guess I got off the trail there in and I read the book quot Compulsory Mis education quot and I ve never quite been able to get the hang of school issues since p p John Taylor Gatto I know both of those writers and they ve had a big influence on me as well p p JB Well tell me John you ve been in the school business thirty odd years teaching in the public schools of New York so can you state here in the beginning what the problem is here with here People are just wringing their hands and it doesn t seem like anything is going to get better with the path that we re on p p JTG Well there s a lot of problems Jerry But I think they boil down to a quick slug of we don t teach the way children learn and because the business has become really a central part of the American economy you re really not allowed to teach the way children learn although any individual component in this system would admit privately that they wish they d allow you to do that You have the perfect example of that out your way an elderly Peruvian immigrant in a school near Los Angeles inside of four years had the best scores on the Advanced Placement Calculus Test I m sure he was an excellent teacher but that s really beside the point He was working with a group of kids with no mathematical tradition and very little literary tradition and inside of a short time Garfield High was the third ranking school in the US on the AP calculus Mr Escalante s fate is just fascinating he was harassed and hounded out the school They made it intolerable for him to stay p p In Chicago there s a black lady named Marva Collins working with black ghetto kids many of them with no intact families She found out what I found later on which was that these children have no resistance to very high level work and ideation In a quick take if you set the idiom aside they re producing work of a caliber that we associate with adults I know this must sound fantastic to your listeners but the truth is you and I could spend hours and not come to the end of people who ve accidentally stumbled on the great dirty secret of American schooling it just doesn t teach the way children learn nor can it be allowed to or maybe that s just momentum and not design We re dealing with a billion dollar a year industry it s the gatekeeper to all of the rest of the jobs We couldn t turn out an excess of competent people without really doing damage to this economy If this sounds like I m playing a conspiratorial string on my violin hardly the president of Columbia s teacher s college Dean Russell in in the keynote speech to the NEA said that there was a tremendous danger that too many leader s would be produced and it would cause a collapse in the system p p JB I m reading where a quote that you have in an article by you by Edward Roth in his book written in called quot Social Control quot says the following quot plans are on the way to replace community family and church with propaganda education and mass media People are only little plastic lumps of human dough quot Now you quote that I suppose because for you it encapsulates the underlying spirit of education in America p p JTG Yeah I actually used that in a book that s coming out in the summer called quot the Empty Child quot by Simon and Schuster Since they wouldn t give me the million words I needed I needed to find the most trenchant reflection of this attitude towards children that they re little plastic lumps of dough Roth of course is not just a professor of sociology he was one of the two or three people who created the American discipline of sociology And you also have a few years later Geddard of Princeton the head of the psychology department who said that standardized testing would function as a dunce cap making people aware of their inferiority making them reluctance to compete and even even reproduce themselves There s a current to this not a strain but a powerful central current right before the first world war reaching a tremendous visible crescendo sometime right after the second world war after which it disintegrated itself rather than provoking controversy as a duty thing and not talk about it p p I stumbled upon all of this while I was trying to figure out why on earth so many people appeared to have a vested interest in trying to stop me from doing what they knew worked in a school setting But I talked to each one of them individually they d admit that that quot its stupid but I have to do it because quot and then they d refer to the next highest person on the administrative ladder Eventually when we got the state education dept and I was able to talk to the people there they began referring to politicians not all politicians but certain politicians And when I spoke to some of their administrative assistants a few were honest enough to refer me to corps great foundations think tanks which were running this particular politician although this was hardly said but I heard that What we have done then displace authority over the lives of children into so many different hands many of those quite invisible that to approach this with a problem solving set of mind is really to frustrate yourself to death We re dealing with a system that s working exactly the way its supposed to work There are ways around that you can sabotage it like I did for many years and that works sometimes locally or parochially until you re caught You can sidestep it by sending your kids to some private schools but most private schools function the same way except that they re more cosmetic You can home school your children I mean they re a variety of ways around it but they re not all tackling the problem p p JB I want to ask you you said that anytime you do something that is right you get blocked Could you give me one example of what you did that was right and was blocked p p JTG Oh sure I ll give you the actual example that triggered my resignation and the op ed editorial in the wall street journal My school system that I continued to succeed in in the sense that my kids were succeeding including the kids that weren t supposed to succeed continued to move me into worse and worse school settings Until finally I ended up at the school that produced of the quot Central Park jogger quot rapists including a number of other distinctions And here using the essentially the same methods but it took a lot longer and I was an older man but using essentially the same methods the kids began to lose their quot kid quot quality and began to become people and have a vested interest in developing their minds and spirits and characters as far as they could When I saw this heartening response my method is then to offer more and more challenges and at some point a challenge to a kid is navigating in the adult world of reality that they see around them dimly p p I had arranged with the president of I ll call it quot Bell Telephone quot in New York to have my kids taken through to visit a telephone station in keeping with things that I had been doing for years At the moment that some executive was dispatched to pick up the kids at the school and take them to the station our principal raced to the door that very moment confronted me and said quot these kids can t go out they haven t filed the proper papers quot I said quot sure I did Jules I dropped those in your box hours ago quot He said quot the policies have changed it has to be done two week in advance sent to the district and approved quot And I said quot ok Jules the next time quot and he said quot No quot In front of some vice president of the phone company with the kids all assembled together At that point I realized that what happened was not an independent decision by the principal but rather a frantic attempt by the school district which happens to be on the Upper West Side of Manhattan In fact they were disturbed by the continued success of children who happened to be under my direction The truth is they could have been under anyone s direction who had followed the same sort of system dirt farmers would have followed years ago p p JB Now what did you do for the kids with the kids that triggered this kind of retaliatory response p p JTG Essentially I operated on a couple of really simple assumptions That this bizarre and disturbing behavior that kids not only poor kids but really prosperous kids in New York were producing was a direct result of their lives being stripped of significant experiences confined in these abstract cells for all of their natural youth and set a diet of low level abstractions Not even the challenging debate material or text that you would have find in a fourth or fifth grade in the middle of the th century I mean that stuff that is reserved for the quot gifted quot or quot talented quot kids The ones in high school are doing sixth or seventh grade work by a century ago s standards p p JB If I can read between the lines you deviated from the standard curriculum that the administration wanted p p JTG I put together what I call a quot guerrilla quot curriculum Jerry and that was composed of stuffing them with primary experiences as much as I could from an ad hoc basis when I would read the paper in the morning or the night before Any kind of news going on I would have advance permission and the kids would be dispatched to investigate One part of this was I brought a kind of seminar standard to the classroom We didn t have to understand I ll use Aristotle as an example we didn t have to understand everything Aristotle was driving at to be absolutely certain that a lively discussion shows that much of what he was driving at were current topics in kids minds Once they got over the barrier of the language gap which is extremely easy to do just like teaching reading is extremely easy to do California s example to the world notwithstanding p p JB OK So you got them into more challenging material in a way which would change based on day to day events in the environment The way the administration saw it this was not in the structure that the curriculum was designed but you get that this was the way to give reality and aliveness to the learning experience p p JTG You re quite right but I think that the dynamic at work is worth exploring because its not as simple as the administration opposing it What s happening is that each subordinate level that has to give permission is on thin ice So that the ball is passed and when the ball leaves the local precincts it s really passed between foundation project officers certain university staff policy people in Washington so that in fact the ball never returns to your court or when it does its invariably ringed around with so many restrictions by other people who are making a living I m not alleging that its conscious but it happens To the point that you don t want to do it anymore p p JB We re taking a break we re talking with John Taylor Gatto John when we get back I want you to comment on the curve marking on the curve in standardized testing as a way to imbed the growing inequality in our society This is Jerry Brown don t go away p p commercial break p p JB Would you comment on the idea that grading on the curve which I presume most schools do is a way to put in a type of bell curve social stratification that is increasingly being replicated in almost every part of America p p JTG The idea very very early on it comes out of Prussian Germany in a series of debates in the th debates that arose out of Prussia that essentially said a mathematical or mathematized predictable world is the best out of all possible things to hope for The big people to read if you ve read Hegel himself I think you d know all you d need to know In order to control everybody certain strategic courses were undertaken in forced schooling There had never been prior to Prussia in the early th century been successful forced schooling in the history of the planet And suddenly Prussia in drew in all of the children put them in a stage system The first stage was to trivialize the greatest learning time by filling it I realize that this is going to get the backs up of some of your listeners with balloons songs and funny games But to keep the intellectual moral part under the control of the teacher Somewhere in the age of the idea was to set everyone suddenly in competition with each other and produce visible marks of rank everyone so that no matter how secure you were in your understanding of something there would always be people you could see who had been visibly recognized as your masters And according to Hegel and a number of other thinkers this constant quot alienation quot that was the world they used which was translated directly to American schools this alimentation would lead to the kind of society which could be placed under the direction of certified experts that the state and the corporate world found safe and productive The net result of this Jerry was that Prussia a dirt poor country in or years was one of the world leaders The Prussian king decided the Canadian American border because he was the most prestigious monarch on earth Hartsman and every other founder of American schooling before we had compulsory schooling went to Prussia and came back with glowing reports of what the Prussians had produced that is to say a predictable society that could be run by the best minds p p What you see on a normal bell curve probably at a moment when assessment is the wrong thing to do its inappropriate people learn on private learning curves We know the point in which we cross the barrier and understand something Some people learn instantly certain things and others learn six years later I will tell you this a kid who learns to read at five and a kid who learns to read at will be indistinguishable to each other at the age of fourteen assuming they both like what they re doing On the other hand we can say its too inconvenient or too expensive to allow that and impose a learning curve in first grade that produces this wonderful bell we can then assign the people on the fringes of the bell to special ed and the people in the middle of the bells the walls of the curve to the dull classes and so on And we will create a class system by simply doing that Inside of a year or two the kids will impose that kind of class system on themselves It s a phenomenally intricate but rather easy to unravel puzzle there reading is pathetically easy to teach you assume that once you assemble people in a room and do it in the same routines that you ll fail to teach it to some of them that this bell will appear and the atmosphere in the classroom is that the humiliation of being a dull reader or bad reader will never wear off You can predict the rise of a giant remediation industry p p On the other hand I want your to compare it to or when the founder of the DuPont fortune wrote to investors in France and said there s a miracle going on in this country because everyone here can read and debate like a lawyer quot There s nobody who can t read and they re facile with numbers quot Or you can look at De Tocqueville s famous analysis when he said that the classical Greeks are children compared to these dirt farmer s kids Look at the best sellers of that day The Last of the Mohicans by James Fennimore Cooper I would urge your readers to get an uncut version of Last of the Mohicans especially if they have one or two college degrees and see what an impossible book it is to read And yet it sold the equivalent of million copies p p JB I notice that you re also saying that judging from the Army Intelligence Test that you have of the whites who can t read and of the African Americans who can t read p p JTG Its just amazing because just in these figures were just for the white group and for the African American group p p JB Do you believe John do you believe those numbers because they re very shocking Ouml p p JTG I believe those numbers from my own experience When you try to reconstruct the intellect of a tear old kid which is essentially what my classroom was about you re dealing with social resistance which is quite unbelievable yet I just got a call today from a kid who had criminal charges against him at and furthermore he was filed as a functional illiterate by the school He s working on his second college degree and trying to decide among offers which would make him leave academia This is a boy that wanted to have a gun at he s only about now So what miracle happened Well the miracle that happened was that he was given himself back and it didn t take a N Y teacher of the year to do that I m not claiming any particular insight other than what was common knowledge a century ago This country was unique in world history because it took ordinary people people who were considered trash in Europe and made them independent hard working self respecting people To deny what is unique about American history is just nuts because in there we have the skeleton key to unlock the problem of our schools p p JB My own grandmother I think went to school until the th grade she was quite a reader well into her s very well read Now we have a world in which this president is saying that we have to create a situation that everyone can have at least two years of college in the same way that I suppose that the th grade was assumed to be necessary at the beginning of the century p p JTG I hope that he s just a dupe Jerry I really hope so The way that the game works is that we say that the reason this problem exists is that A we don t have enough money and B we don t have enough of the kids lives to work on them So we ve watched schooling go from an average weeks and produce a totally literate nation p p JB weeks or years p p JTG weeks The truth is that nowhere in the US as late as nowhere did more than of the people go to school p p JB And when they went to school you re saying that they only went for weeks That s only a couple of months p p JTG And kids who went for longer than that didn t go every day or even every week So they came and went And furthermore they were under the control of one woman who had ages and class sizes of that s an impossible situation according to the way we do business today And yet as soon as you change the teacher student ratio from the teacher being of the solution and the student to the reverse of that the student of the solution the teacher then you can see how very large classes or mixed classes can work because the kids are responsible teaching each other p p JB What I m hearing here one of the key building blocks more important than TV in the development of a society of dependent obedient sheep like herdlike uncritical people is that the school is the mechanism of schooling enshrined as a secular religion So if the goal is independent thinking self reliance critical thinking all the good stuff that Abe Lincoln Benjamin Franklin held up as such important values then somehow this whole schooling mechanism needs to be smashed And I want to get that very clear because there is a childlike devotion to the school system that reminds me of the quot Devotion of the Blessed Mother quot at St Brendan s grammar school years ago p p JTG It was sold that way all of this the various media sold it this way I m not saying that there was a cabal but simply that it was the way it was presented to them Flattering luncheons where the decision has been made to take that wonderful woman who had run without an administration those one room schools which had done so well and put her under the direction of an apparatus of men not just a single layer but infinite layers which are still being spun out p p JB It almost sounds like the apparatchiks in the late stage Soviet Union p p JTG That s an excellent kernel The question is whether this grows naturally as a result of certain economic decision MIT makes mandatory I believe a book called quot Autonomous Technology quot by Langdon Winter written about years ago in which Winters says once you start with certain premises it is inevitable that the system will eventually control all the personnel the apparent leaders will remain only as long as they serve the system s purposes if they don t heir marginalized and gotten rid of and someone else is put in p p A lot of them that the family was the barrier to a sane future They may not have liked each other but they all agreed that you had to get children away from the family School was the mechanism to utopianize I think both things are at work here ideologues who communicate this idea and are able to perpetuate themselves from generation to generation They control hiring at universities and foundations and so on and look for people like themselves p p JB Today we get a report of Al Shanker s funeral a memorial Al Shanker being the head of the United Federation of Teachers of America probably the most powerful educator of this country And you have Senator Kennedy representing the Left wing of the remnant Democratic Party and you have former New York City mayor Ed Koch once a Democrat but now a populist corporatist conservative former New York mayor So you have a pretty wide spectrum at least on the left right spectrum giving real encomiums of adulation to the creative work of Shanker which as far as I know without speaking ill of the deceased Shanker was a pillar of this entire apparatus which you have been criticizing for the last minutes p p JTG He was Let me say not in Shanker s defense but an explanation of how Shanker managed to draw support from all portions of the political spectrum Shanker was to his credit very outspoken of the division that he represented Shanker is as close to being a classical old line socialist nor did he make any bones about that Shanker is on record a number of times saying that schools are not about the best destiny for the children schools are not about making Johnny s family stronger or bringing his parents in on the governance or deliberations I had dinner twice with Shanker I was at this small table with him and I must say that compared to everyone else at the table probably me included that Shanker absolutely said what was on his mind laughs Not that I agreed with him p p JB But that s the real issue what is on his mind and what s on America s mind is that the problem of America is that there is not enough education there s not enough getting to these poor people who are causing all of the crime or there s not enough in the middle to compete with the Japanese or the Chinese or all of those smart people And the answer is whether it s the market based people who have their strategy or the liberals who have theirs one way or another its to get these little kids more programs for the competitive world and not for the kind of disruptive individual critical thinking which I believe you re suggesting and that I certainly very much recommend p p break p p JB John I m going to read you something that you ve said and I m going to ask you how to attain what you re suggesting I quote quot We have to radically decentralize government corporate schooling return the power of designing and assessing programs to the local level and ensure that every form of training for the young aims at producing independent self reliant minds good characters and individuals who get fighting mad when called a quot human resource quot and told their main function is to be part of the work force Ok great I accept that so how do we get there Who do we attack and what do we build p p JTG The schema first has to be seen clearly as long as the economy is built up of very large corporations very large institutions and very large government agencies by necessity all the training that is approved leads towards some position on the pecking order of these giant employment pyramids I d like to jump from that to two groups who have never participated in that and who ve had a sort of blemished record of success I d like to do this to allow your listeners to independently verify that its possible p p Look at Johns Hopkins University not one of my favorite universities but they ve been tracking the Amish for a long time They ve published several I think mind blowing books about what has happened in Amish America In this century at the beginning of the century there were of these people now there are So the group itself has retained its integrity and grown times Second of the Amish or as close to that as humanly possible has independent livelihoods and its divided in small entrepreneurial businesses and in small farms Now consider the drawbacks these people labor under the government of Pennsylvania has been their sworn enemy through the century And they don t use telephones they don t use computers they don t use cars and they go to the sup th sup grade only because the Supreme Court cut a deal with them in the So with all these drawbacks you have a community that with all intents and purposes has no crime at all that takes care of old and young because it mixes both of those groups together in the life of the community is amazingly successful amazingly wealthy and amazingly unschooled Now many of your listeners or my friends who would no doubt say that it s that religious glue that pious glue that gives them the advantage So I d like to jump to the group that s resolutely militantly free thought probably as any that s ever existed p p And that s in the Basque country in Spain the north west of Spain and its forgive my accent the Mondragon Cooperative There s about the same number of these people as there are Amish and they aim for exactly the same grown up solution that everyone will have an independent livelihood or they ll be a part of a small group that makes its living proving to other people that it s valuable So their schooling is resolutely directed toward developing the kind of independent self reliant tough minded characteristics that oddly enough Amish education also stresses p p So here we have bracketed now two groups that are small but not that small who manage to keep what Lincoln s idea for America was Independent livelihood was where it was at You know back in the s s it was impossible to assemble an American work force over because people would only work for you long enough to get a little stake and then cut off and go off on their own When we look at the history of New England factories that they re going to concerts and dances and libraries for the young girls who worked there for just a couple of years until they could bring a little stake to their marriage That was the American dream that you could write the script to your own life And very very gradually that dream was converted and this is quite easy to track not by evil people but by people who understood that wealth depends on your ability to command labor And unless you can assemble large groups of labor you were never going to be wealthy as the Europeans reckoned wealth or the English reckoned wealth p p JB Ok John since we have a few callers on the line I d like to encapsulate what you re saying that the accumulation of great wealth requires the ability to command labor You cannot labor if its independent and critical therefore you need a schooling system much in the way that obedience school provides for dogs they have to be taught not to pee in the house or heel at their master s beck and call And in effect the entire school enterprise and there are obvious examples is a huge obedience school run on the kennel model And the two examples you ve given me Amish which is based on a character traditional very family based with a very god centered decentralized form and the other one which you refer to as secular is the worker owned cooperatives in the Basque land in Spain Two poles which are totally at variance with the consumer mass obedience operation which is cheerleaded from Jesse Jackson on the Left or Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan even more to the Left to you know the Right Wing folks the Moral Majority and the chamber of commerce p p So if I hear you right what we really have to face up to is the absolute need for a critical distancing from this whole status quo which seeps into our deepest aims p p JTG Absolutely that s a perfect abstract Notice that we can eliminate Marxist ideas that evil or venal people are doing this What is happened is that the people who are doing this have convinced themselves quot scientifically quot that this is the only that it can be This is what sociologist Thomas Malthus biologist Charles Darwin or chemist John Dalton all said This is what the book the Bell Curve a couple of years ago said This is the way wishes it to be it can t be any other way So they have to overlook Jaime Escalante in California or Marva Collins in Chicago or even John Taylor Gatto in New York They have to overlook the Basques they have to overlook the Amish because they don t fit that theory p p JB So John then I take it you have no objection to vouchers p p JTG Its not that I have no objection to vouchers there s a real danger built into vouchers and that is the same sort of surveillance over your kids lives will follow the voucher What we have to do and we re going to do it whether its allowed or now we have to begin to break the fealty to these enormous organizations whether they re government or corporate or institutions p p JB Ok let s take a few calls now Craig has been waiting go ahead Craig p p Craig Thank you for your recent programs with Susannah Shepherd and Grace Malone We are a home schooling family for many years and I guess in a sense I d like to explain why it is we home school I d like to start by recommending a book quot Teaching as a Subversive Activity quot by Neil Postman and Charles Weingartner And I d would say that anyone who has an interest in this subject if you have not read that book consider yourself uneducated That book was written in didn t deal with home schooling but it does explains the need to raise children who do not just accept the unexamined assumptions of our society That impulse is out there across the country but its really at war against what seems to be a stronger approach to suppress that kind of approach I know there are exceptions there are good teachers who really want to educate kids in the truest sense of the term but they re fighting the system What I really want to say here is that the school system at its heart even though yes its their to in some sense to educate the children but at its heart its really there to break their spirits That is what I think all the time We ve had some experience with our own children for short periods of time at our local schools and its only confirmed and reinforced what we already thought we knew p p JB Thank you Craig very eloquent John p p JTG I d like to comment on what Craig said on breaking the spirit The most influential US commissioner of education that ever existed was William Torre Harris and in a book he wrote back in The Philosophy of Education he said that the purpose of schooling was to alienate children from their families their churches their neighborhoods and themselves I mean it wasn t a secret its just that people who walk their dogs or look at the sun come up in the morning they don t have time to read books called quot The Philosophy of Education quot laughs Of course that s what it s about p p JB Amazing p p JTG He was the only prominent school man who and I believe that s still true who was a house guest to the Rockefellers the Carnegies Harris brought German schooling to the US and made sure that it stuck p p JB All right let s take a call from Angel in New Jersey p p Angel Hi thank you both My question concerns what I seem to see as an apparent contradiction between the acknowledged purpose of the school systems as they now stand and the stated belief that they can in fact be altered without actually altering the primary purposes of society In other words with corporations wanting a docile work force with a government needing a military going overseas and to engage in practices that many would consider are against the very interests of the very people who are being asked to fight in that military why would you believe that under the current system that people who are in control of the schools ultimately the politicians would in fact want to change the system so that it would in fact produce critical thinkers p p JB Ok angel you ve just asked the question I think you re hitting it right on the head here you re going to need to change a lot more than just the schoolhouse p p JTG Angel let me speak to that One of the great ways that people are held in place by their own fear Because these enormous employment pyramids control the flow of money and even the flow of information around the whole country you might assume that nothing can be done about them The truth is they have almost no internal cohesion at all they hate each other Look how fast the soviet union came apart I would like to just tell you very quickly here that I sat with Jeane Kirkpatrick about two weeks before the first signs of the crack took place There were a few other people in the room and she said in that cold steely flinty voice of hers quot let me tell you that it won t be for a hundred years that you see a crack in the soviet union because they have a personal dossier of every citizen and they have mathematical ways of telling where the fault lines will appear quot And two weeks later of course it was dying and a short time after that it was dead p p JB Ok John John we ve got to break in One hour has gone by We ll do it again we ll do it again but we are out of time We ll come back to this topic again there s a lot more to dig in and there s a lot of people who want to talk about the public schools This is Jerry Brown for We the People thanks for
